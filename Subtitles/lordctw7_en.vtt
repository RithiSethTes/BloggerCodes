WEBVTT

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.970
Faster.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.180
I don't want to die so young.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.150
Hurry up.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.170
OK.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.030
I'm so exhausted.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.729
Why do you seem to be

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.160
in danger every time we meet?

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.860
Yang Ze!

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.750
I didn't expect to see you here.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.610
This is my friend

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.800
Yang Ze.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.750
Thank you.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.520
You...

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.290
Are you alright?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.410
Is there any internal injury?

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.329
He did nothing to you?

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.370
Yes. I'm fine.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.370
I just

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.970
accidentally got separated from you.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.650
Then you can go back the same way

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.579
and catch up with us.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.050
If you use the Magic

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.280
to go fast,

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.480
even if I had gone back,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.080
I wouldn't have found you.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.620
So I thought

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.580
I'd wait for you

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.620
where you may go by.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.560
How did you know?

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.710
I thought

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.200
you might go to the Imperial Capital,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.079
if that's the case,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.880
you'd have to come to the Ryen City Pier.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.560
So I'm here to try my luck.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.600
Well,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.740
it seems I was right.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.360
You're smart.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.000
I was so worried after you leave,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.030
as that man didn't say anything.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.190
I was afraid he'd hurt you.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.960
What were you worried about?

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.590
He is just a civilian.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.360
Who would deal with a civilian?

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.000
Maybe there are someone who forces a civilian

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.750
to get married?

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.790
What do you mean by that?

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.750
I'm telling the truth.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.720
I'll ask them to prepare some dessert.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.390
Would you excuse me?

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.540
I'll go and see if we have any tails.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.760
This one is mine.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.100
You drank Tian Xin's just now.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.390
I'm doing it for justice.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.810
They still don't know my real identity.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.980
What about you?

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.240
Are you exposed?

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.430
Not at all.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.610
Then what happened?

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.880
I accidentally discovered

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.440
some secrets that should not be known.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.820
I have arranged a new identity for you.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.040
I'm here this time

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.370
just to send you away.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.940
No.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.650
I have to go back to the Heavenly Intelligence Center.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.530
You want to go back now?

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.560
Now that they don't have any proof

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.159
to say that I am the traitor,

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.580
I need to go back

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.630
and sweep out all the information about me.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.990
Only in this way,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.040
I can escape from the control of the HIC.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.340
So,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.930
I have to go back.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.060
Do you have to do it in person?

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.360
Kynil.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.750
I've informed my family in the Imperial Capital.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.450
They will prepare the money.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.520
As soon as we go back,

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.560
I'll pay you back in double.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.130
I thought you were worried about friends.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.720
It turns out you just want the money.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.090
That's for your dowry.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.730
I don't care about money.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.130
Rosemary,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.100
I saved your life, right?

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.720
So we're even.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:53.460
After dinner,

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.220
we will go separate ways, OK?

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.170
No way!

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.940
You promised to marry me.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.530
How can you do that?

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.020
You are going to marry a civilian,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.840
but I'm not.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.030
I don't care.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.770
You have to marry me.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.220
I'm telling you,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.200
you can't go back

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.080
on your word.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.760
You have to obey your own rules.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.710
What kind of princess are you?

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.030
Ouch!

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.370
Her father is not just a marquis.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.540
What?

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.400
Princess Rosemary's father

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.200
is Lord VI of Xuancang,

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.920
Theo.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.830
He is also

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.480
the only lord with royal blood.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.060
Then why

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.490
her lord

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.500
wants her to marry a civilian?

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.120
The lord's wife,

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.560
who's also the mother of Rosemary,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.010
doesn't want her to be a magician again.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.440
So she ordered her to marry

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.340
a civilian who doesn't know magic or has a rank.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.610
Your mom is so wise.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.460
But I don't think so.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.280
I want to marry

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.480
a man with powerful magic.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.860
So you found me.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.740
Because

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.560
my magic is too strong, right?

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.370
I chose you because you are stupid

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.390
and easy to control.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.990
You're just my excuse with my family.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.909
You can say whatever you want.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.740
I have escaped from your home,

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.330
and I saved you.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.130
I'm so great.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.680
How did you know about this?

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.090
I worked for the HIC,

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.370
and I was in charge of searching information.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.910
And I also know that

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.740
the HIC has

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.660
important information about you.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.500
What information?

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.760
Your father is not dead.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.760
Where is he?

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.930
Why didn't he appear for so many years?

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.160
I knew it.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.170
I know he is still alive.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.870
I only know that much.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.430
As for more details,

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.450
I didn't have the access for that.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.210
I don't know.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.270
I thought you left

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.059
because you knew some secrets that you shouldn't.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.640
Why don't you know about my father?

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.179
Why don't you know where he is?

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.850
Wow, wow, wow.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.250
Easy. Easy.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:46.730
Calm down.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.620
She's young and reckless.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.910
Forgive her.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.030
What's the difference just tell me this?

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.980
I'll have to live like I used to.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.640
Without a title,

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.060
I just practice magic by myself,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.180
and I have to marry someone I don't want to.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.970
Why are you only telling me this?

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.290
Princess,

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.800
if you want to get rid of the fate of marrying civilians,

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.580
I know the answer.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.480
But the cost is big.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.440
Do you

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.830
want to try?

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.200
How?

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.880
The method is in the HIC.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.670
Isn't it where the men in black are?

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.830
I won't go.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.260
I know a secret path to the HIC.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.560
If we go from there,

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.160
no one will notice.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.950
Why are you helping me?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.990
You helped me escape today.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.390
I'm doing it as a thank you.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.470
Guess what?

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.530
The thing between Rosemary and I have been settled.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.780
You have to thank me in another way.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.350
Anyway, I won't go.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.950
I was thinking if you would accompany me,

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.380
I'll give you some gold as a thank-you gift.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.460
What's more,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.860
maybe there will be secret treasure in the HIC

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.510
or something else.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.790
It's a pity.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.360
That's enough.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.310
You know I'm a man

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.720
that both handsome and

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.840
talented,

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.550
and I'm warm-hearted.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.120
So,

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.040
I'm happy to help.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.040
Yang Ze,

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.270
we seem to lose those men in black.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.110
After we land,

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.590
I'll go find Yin Chen to ask for help.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.230
You know Yin Chen?

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.080
Of course.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.270
Yin Chen is my...

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.230
Your what?

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.550
He's my idol.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.390
You're day dreaming.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.400
Anyway,

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.880
as long as I'm asking, he will definitely help.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.690
Believe it or not.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.180
Whether you can find Yin Chen or not,

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.750
this time,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.980
it has to be done by yourselves.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.340
Why?

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.020
Yeah, why?

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.680
Yin Chen is a lord.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.870
If he gets involved,

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.390
it's Lord VII

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.670
unreasonably interfere Lord VI's business,

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.480
it will cause much more trouble.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.250
That's right.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.770
My family can't know about this.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.070
Fine.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.290
I'll cut you some slack today.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.860
You don't have to

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.700
pretend that you know Yin Chen.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.010
OK then.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.140
Lord V,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.380
here we are again.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.590
I've been looking for you for three days.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.340
In order to repay me,

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.560
show me what you got.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.970
You have seen my Beast and Halidom.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.270
What do you think?

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.290
Are you satisfied with me as your opponent?

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:24.860
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.310
Neither did Lotus.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.880
I won't fight you.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.930
Are you afraid of me?

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.380
I just don't want other

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.150
innocent lives to get involved.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.110
You'd better worry about yourself

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.430
and your baby sister.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.270
Hey, stop running.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.230
Tian Xin,

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.580
are you sure sneaking into the HIC is not dangerous?

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.350
Kynil is my friend.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.480
I don't want anything bad happen to him.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.320
Don't you worry about me?

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.830
So I opposed you from the beginning.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.890
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.170
As for them,

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.490
it should be fine, too.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.480
Since you're determined to go,

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.020
don't show your face

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.720
preparing goods.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.110
Let others do it.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.960
You're not going to tell Yin Chen about it?

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.950
This is very dangerous.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.380
I'm finally free.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.810
Why am I going back?

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.840
Moreover,

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.020
I've been disappeared for so long.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.820
He didn't even look for me.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.480
I experienced life and death today.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.320
And where is my lord?

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.000
He doesn't care about me at all.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.660
Isn't there some shared bond

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.610
between a lord and his disciple?

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.450
Actually, I can't blame him.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.280
Tian Xin said

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.050
I can't control my Magic.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.060
He shouldn't feel my danger.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.460
Then you should tell Yin Chen about it.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.580
It will definitely be dangerous later.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.100
You're just being paranoid.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.820
I have Tian Xin and Rosemary with me.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:37.570
No way.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.390
I will accompany you to talk to Yin Chen.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:41.580
No need.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.780
If we go to him now,

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:44.850
he'll be like

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.240
¡°What are you doing with him again?¡±

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.890
If he knows that I made a lot of trouble,

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.390
he'd punish me for sure.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.840
I'll tell him that I run into you.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.970
That won't work.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.020
Although Yin Chen has a poker face,

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.220
he can see right through me

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.460
at one glance.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:01.700
So,

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.330
he will punish me for that.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.920
If he knows about this, he will punish me even more.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.730
I might as well wait.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.550
It's better to get punished once.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.330
Right?

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:13.910
OK.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.830
Let's go. Rosemary's waiting.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.110
Kynil?

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.260
He's disciple of Lord VII now?

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.680
You don't want to show me your Beast

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.110
or your Halidom?

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:33.770
Or

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.260
the person who secretly helps you?

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.100
I do not know what you're talking about

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.940
I won't fight you.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.600
Moreover,

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.420
you know what my talent is?

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:46.920
Fine.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.330
After all, execute Lord V according to the Red Order

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.610
is such a rare opportunity.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.810
I don't want to waste it.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.390
But no matter what

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.170
I will let you go all out to fight against me.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.660
I'll give you one more day.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.250
Then I will wait for you at your place.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.850
Don't bail on me.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.100
Otherwise,

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.630
your little friends

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.210
will be killed one by one.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.630
Don't make me wait too long.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.490
They're all Magicians in the HIC.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.410
You have no Magic.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.710
It's too dangerous to go in.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.510
You said the secret path is safe

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.390
and won't be noticed if we go from there.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.850
I did say that.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.320
But just in case.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.480
You'd better not go.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:48.570
Yang Ze,

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.790
stay on the ship.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.380
That's right.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.910
You are clumsy,

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.270
if you trigger the alarm,

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.530
we'll have to save you.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.770
Yang Ze,

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.280
if you stay on board,

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.329
you can take us to the sea immediately

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.920
when the HIC people chase us.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:08.960
But...

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.270
All three of us have Magic,

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.410
and we'll go in from the secret path.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.349
We'll be back before you know it.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.329
Alright.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:22.000
Promise me,

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.650
if you get caught, don't fight.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.970
Come back to the ship immediately

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.099
and I'll take you away.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.580
OK. I promise.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.520
By the way,

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.070
These are the Blast Fireballs that my family gave me.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.360
Take them with you.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.410
Just in case.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.250
We're good.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.050
Take them.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:42.500
OK.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.850
When I come back,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.060
I'll return them to you.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.010
Let's go.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.690
The secret path to the HIC is behind the door.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.800
But to open this door needs Magic.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.550
I was hunted by the HIC.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.740
So my Magic has been recorded.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.760
So I can't

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.420
use it to open the door.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.300
So what should we do now?

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.780
I don't know how to use Magic.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.410
The secret is behind this door.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.200
You have to open it on your own.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.470
On my own?

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:02.810
Close your eyes.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.340
Focus.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.620
Concentrate all your Magic here.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.360
Have a try.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.140
Don't be nervous, relax.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.210
Clear your mind.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.650
Try again.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.680
It's open!

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.620
I did it.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.280
It turns out

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.100
you're really good at it.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.580
Of course.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.140
I'm better than you.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.280
The Information Chamber is down the hall.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.630
Once I get there,

00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.450
my Magic will

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.940
trigger the alarm.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.770
So I can only get you here.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.350
You'll leave us like this?

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:07.930
Princess,

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.590
the thing you want to know

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.830
is in the east corner in that chamber.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.860
Do as I just said,

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.760
and you won't get caught.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.500
Is it OK no matter how long we're in there?

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.640
It should be.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.400
But hurry up, just in case.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.150
After we come out,

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:24.490
we'll take the same way to go back?

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.620
I'll wait for you at the door that we came in from.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.600
Put on your veils and hurry.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:34.790
Go.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.130
These are just stone pillars.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.420
Where is the information?

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.350
Let's look for it first.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.500
There must be some switches.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:58.430
These pillars

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.610
are moving regularly.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.540
I see.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.270
The information Tian Xin mentioned

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.340
must be hidden inside these pillars.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.950
So if we can find their movement pattern,

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.160
we can find the information we want.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.080
That Tian Xin.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.390
He brought us here,

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.330
but didn't tell us how to find the information.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.780
Maybe he didn't know, either.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.530
But the things carved on the pillars

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.220
are not characters.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.230
They must be some symbols.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:46.860
This HIC

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.470
is so mysterious.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.000
The owner must be quite something.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.510
Do you understand these?

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.010
These symbols

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.210
are not commonly used at all.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.500
Then why are you still staring?

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:16.600
I thought it was easy

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.480
to find the information about the secret treasure.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.500
Why is it so difficult?

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:23.830
By the way,

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.400
listen carefully.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.890
The gold you owe me,

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.660
I want that in pure gold.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.780
Don't try to pay me in some other way.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.240
Rosemary,

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.930
did you touch anything?

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:21.850
Just save it.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.110
It's an ice cage barrier.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.170
If you try to break it,

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.790
there will be more and more ice spears.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.070
But this is the HIC.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.720
Why is there an ice cage?

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.680
This is a trap.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.520
We may be set up by someone.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.690
Being set...

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.870
If that's the case, we have to get out now.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.110
The people you're waiting for won't be here.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:02.570
They were trapped.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.790
People I'm waiting for?

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.040
Kynil.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.290
I saw you with him on the street today.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.160
Then I followed them to the HIC.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.730
But I couldn't get in the chamber.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:13.690
You know Kynil?

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:15.710
How is he doing now?

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.680
I wanted to help.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.980
But I can't be an enemy of the HIC.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.470
So I couldn't do it.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.320
What shall I do?

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.060
I can't go to the HIC, either.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.670
Although you and I can't,

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.450
Lord Yin Chen can save him.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.350
Lord Yin Chen?

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.020
Protecting his disciple

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.960
is the mission of every lord.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:47.450
Don't hesitate any more.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:48.460
Just go.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.040
It's such a waste.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.340
What are you doing?

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.290
I'm trying to make fire and burn the ice.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.560
You can't do that.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.040
You may burn us alive.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.460
Fine.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:33.660
Turn over.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.520
Turn over.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.020
What are you doing now?

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:40.410
I'm going to use...

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.260
I'm going to use hot water to melt the ice.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:45.870
What were you thinking?

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.240
The icicle is so thick,

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.440
how could it be possible?

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.800
You wouldn't know if you never try.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.110
Go ahead.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.670
Can you figure out a way?

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.610
Why there're two disciples?

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:06.650
Where's Tian Xin?

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.460
You are a disciple, too?

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:12.780
Sir,

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.100
do you mean

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.290
you caught us by mistake?

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.380
Since it is a misunderstanding,

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:18.930
would you let us go?

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.200
We won't haggle over it.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.220
We didn't catch Tian Xin today,

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.070
instead, we caught two disciples by mistake.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.130
I'm afraid that if Lord IV blames us for it,

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.590
we'll be in big trouble.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.360
You said you know Yin Chen,

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.150
and you are a disciple.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:34.670
Then you must be disciple of Lord VII.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.670
I've told you already.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.590
But you didn't believe me.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.640
This is Tian Xin's plan all along.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.670
Tian Xin set the trap

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.520
and used the disciples as shields.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.370
Is it possible that they are his accomplice?

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.090
This is serious.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.160
It must be reported quickly.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.350
Aye.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.880
We are not his accomplice.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.590
Let us go.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.270
You made a mistake

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.380
but you don't want to admit it.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.780
Man up!

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.830
We are disciples of Lord VI and Lord VII,

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.670
but now I feel so humiliated.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:09.750
Let us go right now.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.440
Tian Xin's betrayal is of great importance,

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.330
I'm ordered to arrest him in here.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.450
Now you two suddenly appeared.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.180
We have reasons to doubt the betrayal of Tian Xin

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.170
is related to Lord VI and Lord VII.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.090
So before things are clear,

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.700
you may leave.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.560
That Tian Xin.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.820
How dare he mess with us?

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.770
Even if the HIC pardon him,

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.440
I won't let him off the hook so easily.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.300
Calm down.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.980
Didn't you hear it?

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:39.660
Once they find out the truth,

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.920
they'll let us go.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.350
What would they do to us anyway?

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.240
You are too na?ve.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.920
Don't worry.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.300
We are disciples.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.460
Come in.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.240
Lord VII,

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.600
I don't have time to explain too much to you.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.140
Kynil is in trouble.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.400
Only you can save him.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.560
The clock is ticking.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.960
Let's go.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.290
I don't care what your true identity is.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:19.690
But you cared about Kynil

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.110
too much, don't you think?

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:23.600
No way.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.160
I will accompany you to talk to Yin Chen.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.110
No need.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:28.900
If we go to him now,

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:29.980
he'll be like

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.630
¡°What are you doing with him again?¡±

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:33.870
If he knows that I made a lot of trouble,

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.630
he'd punish me for sure.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.550
I just ran into Kynil by accident.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.280
I didn't mean to follow him.

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:43.640
Kynil is my friend, and now he is in danger,

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.620
how can I stand by and watch?

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.110
Tea?

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.880
Although it's not as good as it in the Imperial Capital,

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.170
but it's better than nothing.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.880
You still have the mood for tea?

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:02.870
Kynil is in danger now.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.760
It's really urgent.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.170
You're right.

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.550
Kynil really got into trouble,

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.700
and it's a big one.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.580
You knew it?

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.620
So you can feel Kynil's situation?

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:19.680
What are you waiting for?

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.300
Let's go save him.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.650
Or he'll be dead!

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.280
You are so anxious,

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:30.670
is it because you're ashamed?

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.060
Ashamed?

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.300
I know you don't like me.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.590
But Kynil is in danger.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.470
I swear

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.740
I have nothing to do with it.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.780
But when I knew about that,

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.180
I've been trying to save him.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.290
Ashamed?

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.920
No. I have a clear conscience about that.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.960
I just don't understand one thing.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:00.160
Why are you acting so cold?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.210
It's you.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:17.720
Good.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.220
You're not that stupid anyway.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.480
Lord, get to the point.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.110
Don't beat about the bush.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.650
You betrayed the HIC,

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.450
and made two disciples

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:29.610
take the fall.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.470
You offended several lords after this.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.710
I really don't know if you are stupid

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.080
or just bad luck.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.550
If that's the case,

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.040
I'll have to make sure of something while I still can.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.830
Lord,

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.790
I hope you can promise me one thing.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.740
Otherwise, I'll kill myself.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.090
If I die here,

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.620
the two disciples

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.590
will be considered to have other attempt

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.720
and they'll have no witness.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.730
What's more,

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.840
you can't get off easily, either.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:13.620
Go ahead.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.449
As long as I could.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:33.440
Is it worth it?

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:35.130
Yes.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:37.210
For her,

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.370
I have nothing to regret.

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:43.590
OK, I promise you.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:49.739
Lord Yin Chen,

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.340
I want to tell you something.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.350
In fact, all lords and disciples

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.060
are in a terrible game.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:59.620
No one can escape.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.960
There's only so much I can say.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.400
Please, Sir.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.630
Can you be quick?

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:19.130
You can't feel it from the outside,

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:21.050
but we are freezing in here.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.270
We didn't receive any message that the two disciples

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.350
will come to the HIC to perform the task.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.570
What should we do now?

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:32.750
Then what were they doing here?

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:34.560
Why did they break into here?

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.830
What does this have to do with Tian Xin?

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.210
How about

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.780
locking them up

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.530
and forcing them to tell the truth

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.110
with the Distract Magic?

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:50.860
Disciples,

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.630
in order not to break the rules,

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.800
we have to use Distract Magic on you right now.

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:55.880
I'm sorry.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.260
What is Distract Magic?

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.300
It's a Magic

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.290
to disturb our mind.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.000
Do you want to hypnotize us?

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.450
I don't allow you to use

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:07.810
such dirty Magic.

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:09.010
I'm telling you,

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.300
you have to wait until my lord is here.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.240
You know what?

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.180
I won't tell you anything.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.820
I won't tell you

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.460
that my dream is to own a big tavern.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.520
And then

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.140
I'll be a millionaire.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.210
Aren't you know everything?

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.490
Do you know where my Beast is?

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.830
Ready?

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.190
My Beast is in my butt.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.480
Yin Chen?

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.940
I thought I would never see you again!

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.760
Lord VII?

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.240
He's the one behind all this.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:57.930
You can take him now.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.800
I'm going to take them with me.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.070
Tian Xin?

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:04.360
Tian Xin.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:05.900
You bastard!

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.940
We trusted you.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:08.550
But you set us up!

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.980
I...

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.440
Tian Xin, you betrayed the HIC.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.110
Lord IV Reya has ordered that

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.970
we have to catch you alive.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:19.110
Do you know what will happen to you?

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.680
I know too many secrets,

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.740
and I also know the HIC won't let me off.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.460
Let's go.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.130
Yin Chen,

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.480
What did Tian Xin mean just now?

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.380
The HIC has strict rules.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:03.770
In order to ensure the absolute confidentiality,

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:06.520
their messengers must not get married for their lifetime.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.630
They are cold like stones.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:11.160
But you have to know

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.090
humans

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.890
are emotional creatures.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:18.290
Emotional?

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.520
When I took Tian Xin to the HIC,

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.180
he told me his story.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.380
I hope you can promise me one thing.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:29.140
Go ahead.

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:30.950
As long as I could.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.420
In a mission a while ago,

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.510
I met a girl.

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:46.850
She risked her life to save mine.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.480
- Go that way!    - Aye!

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:33.380
She made me realize

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.220
kindness and love

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.010
can give us courage and warmth.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:46.520
That's the power of love.

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:51.120
Is it, Kynil?

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:52.780
Cut the nonsense.

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:55.470
All I can think of is that you owe me gold.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.220
Watch this.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.440
See?

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:10.920
Yin Chen is very cute.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.220
Every time I touch him...

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:14.390
He'll be like this.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:15.700
He's a neat freak.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:16.510
You think that's funny?

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:18.990
Of course.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.150
I enjoy being with you.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.910
It's more and more interesting.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.830
You know, I haven't seen you these days.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.240
I felt empty inside.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.130
Kill Tian Xin.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.300
Who are you?

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.570
Disciple of Lord II, Shen Yin.
