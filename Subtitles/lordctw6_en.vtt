L.O.R.D. Critical World

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.760
Episode 6

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.740
Childe Kynil!

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.600
Stop struggling.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.130
Since you were welcomed

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.900
to the Princess’s with a great fanfare,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.710
how can we just let you go directly?

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.410
Don’t put we servants on the spot.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.390
You’ve seen Princess,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.750
and the ceremony is supposed to be held tomorrow.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.180
But Princess means that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.720
all shall be simple

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.960
and economical.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.570
Besides, today, you and Princess

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.229
can know each other better.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.210
Childe Kynil!

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.880
Princess is very stubborn.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.510
You’d better listen to her on everything,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.970
so you can have an easier life.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.210
Go in.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.190
Wait a minute!

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.850
Wait a minute!

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.829
Wait!

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:37.280
Wait!

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.829
There’s something wrong.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.070
It seems that the situation is to my advantage.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.430
After all, Rosemary is a woman.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.070
Although she’s a little arrogant,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.180
she must be shy at this moment.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.040
Maybe she’s more scared than me.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.340
Right. I’ll scare her.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.530
Let me go.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.980
No way!

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.060
I just said you were more nervous than me.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.030
My lady, can’t you be a little reserved?

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.720
Good Heaven! How strong you are!

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.070
Well.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.230
We’re not married,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.760
and you can’t wait to go to bed with me.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.310
I understand your mood.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.580
I’m eager to do that, too.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.590
Stop.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.120
Oh, stop.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.659
No, please don’t.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.860
Princess Rosemary,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.550
actually, there’s something important

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.130
that I didn’t tell you.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.760
If you know it,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.200
you will definitely reconsider

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.860
our marriage.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.760
Besides a Magician,

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.320
I’m also...

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.250
Oh, the hand of Princess

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.290
feels rough.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.570
Oh lord, why am I thinking about the rough hand?

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.840
I must focus on figuring out a way.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.320
Relax.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.060
To be honest, for this thing,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.720
I have no loss.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.750
If I give in now,

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.940
how can I turn the table?

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.940
Right. I’ll be tough.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.840
I’ll scare her away.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.830
It’s just a kiss.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.600
How can I fear you?

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.870
Who are you?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Aren’t you Rosemary?

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.670
Rosemary, you tricked me again!

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.370
Princess said that

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.320
if I scared you, she’d give me ten Shells,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.760
if I pushed you over, twenty Shells,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.470
and if I kissed you, fifty Shells.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.790
If I made you cry,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.840
I’m a man, why do I...

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.040
If you cried, I’d give her three silver coins.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.400
Princess.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.360
Tell me

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.930
how can I make you cry?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.280
Are you crazy?

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.900
Why should I cry?

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.680
I cry while she gets the money?

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.880
You caused troubles on my husband-selecting ceremony.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.650
If I don’t teach you a lesson,

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.050
maybe you’ll harm other women.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.480
Today, I do this

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.320
to make you remember that.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.560
Well done!

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.800
Although he didn’t cry,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.850
I’m still satisfied.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.990
Thank you, Princess.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.370
See you.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.760
Yes.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.920
What’s wrong?

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.910
Don’t you like the small gift I gave you,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.440
my bridegroom?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.160
Now you behave like a little woman!

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.240
When you made troubles at my ceremony,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.910
didn’t you have much fun?

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.970
But now you become a wuss!

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.240
I’m a wuss.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.610
I’m a wuss.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.470
Dear Princess Rosemary,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.420
it’s my fault to have ruined your ceremony.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.840
It’s my fault.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.130
Don’t be angry.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.090
See? You also tortured me.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.420
So, we’re even, okay?

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.640
Don’t be angry, okay?

00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.930
Don’t be angry.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.930
Well, let’s get married tomorrow.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.360
Are you crazy?

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.640
You’re Princess while I’m a bartender.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.650
Why must you marry me?

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.410
Are you hopeless with your life?

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.060
No.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.920
I just feel that life

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.890
is full of hope and surprise.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.110
I don’t care about your background.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.200
I’m born in a rich family. That’s enough.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:29.960
Be good.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.010
Since you choose to be my husband,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.510
we’ll get married someday.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.630
Because you marry with Princess, who’s in a higher position,

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.570
you must obey me on everything later.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.059
Bah!

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.310
You, Princess, tries every means to marry me.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.880
Later? Forget it.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.150
Since you drank the engagement wine and took the bride price,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.590
our marriage is settled.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.160
I remember people who cheat the royal family shall be beheaded.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.480
What’s great to be in a royal family?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.800
I’m Lo...

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.400
Lo

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:05.680
Lo what?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.240
Mind your words and behavior.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.500
Don’t reveal yourself.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.170
I’m loath to

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.150
let a woman decide the marriage for a man.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.050
Whatever I do, I’ll die.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.410
I’ll make no bones about it.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.740
Believe it or not, I’ll release the Beast to bite you!

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.090
I’m so scared.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.800
Release it.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:28.940
Untie the rope for me.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.530
I’ll release it outside.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.290
There’s not enough room.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.250
Tian Xin,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.760
you’re still a secret emissary of the Heavenly Intelligence Center.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.070
It’s dangerous to leave the Imperial Capital.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.850
Leader, don’t be nervous.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.000
I just accepted the tasks of the Heavenly Intelligence Center.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.750
Besides, I believe they haven’t

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.910
targeted me as the traitor of the Heavenly Intelligence Center.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.090
Nonetheless you should be careful.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.320
If Lord IV knows that

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.800
you had connections with Dark Tide,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.510
you’ll be at risk.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.040
I know.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.800
So I think I can had in some

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.250
information on Dark Tide

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.740
to reduce their suspicion on me.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.150
No problem.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.680
We already abandoned one of our strongholds,

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.040
where were the dead bodies of some fellows.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.100
You’ll make sure to be the first to get there.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.370
I know.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.150
I’ll settle

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.360
the bodies of our fellows.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:35.520
Thanks a lot.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.180
Oh, by the way,

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.530
Yin Chen, Lord VII is in Ryen City.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.840
To track his exact location,

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.250
I still need some time.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.530
Don’t bother.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.240
I’ll ask others to handle these incidents.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.880
Your primary task is to protect yourself.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.880
And the best way is to

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.630
escape from the Heavenly Intelligence Center.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.760
Can you help me?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.160
Then just mind your own business.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.710
As the leader of Dark Tide,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.100
you take up the heavy responsibility.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.840
Don’t bother to worry about my business.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.800
We’ve been thinking about ways.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.170
No matter when we entered the Heavenly Intelligence Center,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.200
or when we decided to help Dark Tide,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.080
and intercept the information on it,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.640
they’re all my choice.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.270
Even if it is a hard road,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.650
I have to walk on it.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.760
Release it.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.550
I’ll do it!

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.310
Oh, you failed to release the Beast.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.050
I’m freaked out!

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.120
What did you do to me?

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:30.980
Yes.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.060
What did I do to you?

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.920
Well, let me think.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.750
Is it because

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.710
the engagement wine I gave you

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.590
was added poison that can seal the Magic?

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.180
The poison is so expensive.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.050
Without me,

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.680
someone may never take it all his life.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.270
How lucky you are!

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.980
You look innocent,

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.690
but I never thought that...

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.840
You ruined my ceremony.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.500
How can you go away as if nothing had happened?

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.600
Such small punishment is a mercy to you.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.280
Do you think I’ll really marry you?

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.270
You wish!

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.570
You don’t want to marry me.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.420
I don’t want to marry you.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.480
Since we have the same thoughts,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.590
why don’t we just part?

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.720
Shut up!

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:51.980
From tonight,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.540
you must stay in my residence

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and can’t go anywhere else.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.430
I’ll just sleep here.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:08.970
It’s so warm.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.000
To make you marry me

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.410
is not easy.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.430
If I marry you,

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.560
I’ll chop you up and feed Ice Fang.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.250
Lord, you called me?

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.720
From the last time you were hurt,

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.670
you gained much Power indeed.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.410
But it’s still too weak.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:10.920
So soon,

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.460
you are on the verge of death again.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.660
Kill You Ming.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.630
Kill him.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.640
Kill You Ming.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.620
You know what?

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.520
Every time you were dying,

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.050
you were desperate to kill me.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.870
You revealed your will of killing, so you lost the chance.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:54.790
Crap!

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.610
Kill You Ming.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.470
Kill You Ming.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.060
Kill You Ming.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.370
Today you’re out of chances.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.630
Finish your task quickly.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.540
Such a beauty.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.520
You really have the heart to hurt her.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.980
Unless she were strong enough to fight with me,

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.500
in my mind, she would be

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:04.859
the same as others.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.859
Shen Yin is different from other disciples.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.640
No other disciples are always trying to kill their lords.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:15.270
If the Silver Priest knows that,

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.640
she will be Red-Ordered.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.150
If I don’t think there’s any problem,

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.310
there won’t be any.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.359
Both Lord of Slaughter and the disciple

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:26.869
are abnormal.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.570
The most abnormal one is criticizing others.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.520
I’m not like you,

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.590
who even disobey the Red Order of the Silver Priest.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.300
Why not go quickly

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.660
and report it to the superior?

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.450
The Heavenly Intelligence Center

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.540
was not established for reporting others’ faults.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.510
I hunted Feng Hun several times,

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.940
and found that there was strong power behind it.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.140
And my Image

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.580
was broken without any reason.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.420
I even can’t sense that.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.170
Then I’m sure keep the Feng Hun

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.860
to draw forth that power.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.980
I’ll go back to the Heavenly Intelligence Center.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.650
Don’t let me bury your dead body.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.200
Kynil!

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.390
What are you doing?

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.050
Have you seen Kynil?

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.210
You...

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.360
come here.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:08.980
Princess.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.830
Go into the room and have a rest.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:11.880
After I finished collecting the dew,

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.550
I’ll prepare the cleaning utensils for you.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.100
The dew...

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.000
Are you crazy?

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.050
You use dew to clean my face?

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:23.830
Princess.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.590
That’s the smart choice.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.200
Princess.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.180
She didn’t prepare the dew for you,

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.280
but for Childe Kynil.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.560
I’ve already prepared yours.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.580
I’ll get it right now.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.100
Childe Kynil!

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.960
You’re my maid.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.160
What are you doing?

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:48.930
Oops!

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.240
The dew is split over.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.430
Childe Kynil will be angry.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.440
You catch the goose so early in the morning.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.550
Do you want to rebel?

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:58.530
No.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.320
Childe Kynil told us

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.270
to catch the goose.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.320
Where is he?

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.450
These plants are very precious.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.080
Just do it quickly.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.820
Don’t make Childe Kynil wait for too long.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.950
Kynil again!

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.570
Princess.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.570
Why did you get up so early today?

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.660
Butler.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.360
You know, Childe Kynil...

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:33.970
Where is he?

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.410
Calm down, Princess.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.440
Childe Kynil is out of kindness.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.200
He wants to...

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.020
What does he want?

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.110
He wants to give you a surprise.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.540
But he asked us to keep the secret.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.240
So you know where he is?

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.290
He’s in

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:01.800
the kitchen?

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:03.870
The kitchen?

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.190
He didn’t run away!

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.160
I’ll see

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.720
what on earth he will do today.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.350
Kynil!

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.140
Kynil!

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.020
Princess.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.520
Why are you here?

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.520
I want to ask you why you are here.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.720
I...

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.880
I’m cooking the breakfast of love for you.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.880
Breakfast of love?

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.400
You asked the cook to find the goose in the yard.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.990
You messed the kitchen up like this.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.110
You’re insane, insane, insane!

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.930
I cook the goose to build up your health.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.520
But I dared not kill it,

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.010
so I asked the cook to help me.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.820
The goose has a bad temper, you know.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.730
It ran out of the kitchen quickly.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.880
Don’t you tell me

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.040
you asked them to collect the dew

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.520
is for cooking the goose.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.500
Yes.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.150
How do you know that?

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.860
The maid split the dew basin over accidentally.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:41.760
That’s all right.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:46.390
I’ll filter the water for some more times.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.990
You mean you have to cut my plants to cook the goose?

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.730
I asked the butler to remove the grass and grow crops.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.280
When we want to cook,

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.760
we can harvest them handily.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.520
Is that right?

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.040
So you mean that

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.200
your turning the garden that I took good care of

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.740
into a mess

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.340
is my fault?

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.840
How come it is your fault?

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.740
I’ll marry you.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.850
It’s what I should do.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.240
It’s good that you know it.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.120
But let me warn you first.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.830
Once you enter the Marquis’, you have no way to escape.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.770
How do you think I do such things

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.270
to make you let me go?

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.280
You wronged me.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.310
You wronged me. Do you know it?

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.510
I thought about it for a long time yesterday.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.240
And I figured it out.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.870
You are Princess,

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.180
while I am an ordinary person.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.070
To marry you

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.800
is a boon for me.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.790
If I don’t so something for you,

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.360
I can’t forgive myself.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.080
I have no means to forgive myself.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:01.920
You...

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.720
You’re willing to marry me?

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.180
Of course, I am.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.300
I couldn’t sleep last night.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.030
I didn’t know what I could do for you,

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.000
but only could

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.640
make you a simple breakfast.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.010
Come and check out

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.530
this ox.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.210
I wanted to use the ox

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.800
and the peony in the yard

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.020
to cook a cold dish for you.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.780
It’s called “Ox Chewing Peony”.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.480
But they said it had a bad implicit.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:37.970
So I gave up.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.300
Now I really have the sense that

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.150
I’m a beauty who will marry a beast.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.010
Good.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.110
So good!

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.640
You’re so smart.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.240
Darling.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.930
You make the flowers pale by comparison.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.120
Your beauty is beyond description.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.500
How did you come up with the name?

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:13.510
I’ll call it

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.720
“Beauty and Beast”.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.120
Come on.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.280
This important task is for you.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.870
Kill the ox.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.200
I’ll lead it by your side.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.040
Good Heaven!

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.240
A mentally disabled man who can use Magic

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.160
is too hard to find.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.280
I’ll go find a doctor for you.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.220
No.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.760
Kill the ox for me.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:03.800
Lord.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.960
The task of eradicating the stronghold of Dark Tide

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.840
is done well.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.080
Thank you, Lord.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.240
What about the other task I gave you?

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.600
What did you find?

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.670
Have you checked the secret letter?

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.120
As soon as I got a message,

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.840
I came to hand it to you.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.950
Really?

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.630
But why do I feel that

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.890
there’s mixed Power on the letter?

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.490
Power of top notch is required to open the letter.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.220
I didn’t have such Power.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.280
Do you mean

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.880
in terms of sensing the Power,

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.090
I made a mistake?

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.600
It’s my fault.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.640
I only thought about finishing the task soon,

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.920
so I forgot to change my clothes.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.920
And the letter was stained.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.600
I thought

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.200
you were followed by the traitor of us.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.070
Have a good rest

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.080
and continue to collect information for me,

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.480
especially on Dark Tide.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:12.720
Yes.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.160
Don’t run about.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:18.480
You know it.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.810
It’s not safe everywhere.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.050
Thank you, Lord.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.280
Do you like it?

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.880
I just tested the temperature for you.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.680
Princess Rosemary.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.700
I ordered the butler

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.920
to ask the most famous perfume maker in the world

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.780
to make the body oil for you.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.110
How do you like it?

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.520
Are you that kind?

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.120
Of course.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.480
The perfume seller made it overnight.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.520
Princess Rosemary.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.320
I sincerely invite you to have a bath.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.680
Kynil will do the unique

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.640
message for you.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.140
Are you crazy?

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.080
Somebody helps! He’s a lecher!

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.280
I have no time to play with you.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.160
I’ll go home to find Yin Chen.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.720
To marry Princess

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.720
is the chance I’ll never have.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.680
Why not look at yourself in the mirror?

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.010
Are you as young and handsome as him?

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.520
I had some achievements in Ryen City.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.380
But what is that guy?

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.800
He comes from the country,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.800
and knows nothing.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.640
What on him attracted Princess?

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.480
Maybe she just likes

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.320
toy boys who can tell jokes.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.680
The guards are too stupid.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.170
Trapping me? No way!

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.400
Should I turn left, or right?

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.880
Whatever.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.960
Since I ran away,

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.920
I’ll just go forward.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.960
Childe Kynil!

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.240
Finally, we find you.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.800
Stop struggling.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.320
Go back to the Marquis’ with us.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.900
I warn you. Don’t come to me,

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.600
or I’ll release the Beast to bite you.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.720
Just show it to us.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.840
Ice Fang!

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.080
You... really know the Magic?

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.380
I

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.640
I know. Of course.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.920
Let me tell you:

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.520
You’re looking for an ordinary person.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.080
But I’m a Magician.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.570
Don’t catch me.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.240
Don’t come.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.120
I’ll bite you!

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.270
Take the bite.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:07.880
Hurry up!

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.800
He’s over there.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.290
Childe Kynil!

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.000
Hurry up!

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.040
Stop running, Childe Kynil.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.100
Childe Kynil, go back with us!

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.050
Childe Kynil!

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.010
Who?

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.460
Who acts against the Marquis’?

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.810
Are you tired of living?

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.620
Marquis’?

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.230
No way.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.920
Kynil is very tricky.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.460
I have to catch him by myself.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.449
Lord Yin Chen didn’t leave Ryen City.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.080
We’re afraid that...

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.150
What?

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.560
Are you afraid?

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:16.920
I’m not.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.650
I just worry that

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.610
he may find what our task is.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.900
If the Silver Priest knows it...

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.440
Are you not confident with the Heavenly Intelligence Center,

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.760
or with me?

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.880
I dare not.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.280
Be at ease,

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.560
Yin Chen’s mind isn’t here.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.600
Do as I say.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:36.670
He won’t do anything to you.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.880
Yes.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.000
Let me try.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.000
I never thought that in such critical time,

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.250
my Magic is somehow brilliant.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.120
What a pity.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.960
Yinchen didn’t see my handsome actions.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.920
Come and chase me!

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.960
You can’t catch up with me.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.510
Come!

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.210
Come!

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:40.130
Come!

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.280
Come!

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.160
Come!

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.260
Kynil, Stop!

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.510
Are you blind?

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.550
What are you doing?

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:01.920
Just go.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:11.680
How dare you?

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.630
Do you know who I am?

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:13.640
How dare you attack me?

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.320
Princess.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.860
The Heavenly Intelligence Center is performing a mission.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.200
Please don’t stop us.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.630
Do you think

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.480
I’m talking to you as Princess?

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:23.040
Who are you?

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.700
Why do you catch me?

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.100
Did you also make the ice plates?

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.200
Oh, they’re here to catch you.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.720
As long as I send you out,

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.810
I’ll be safe.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:41.110
Naive.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.760
They already saw me with you.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.600
Only if both of us die will they stop.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.020
What are they?

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:50.140
The Heavenly Intelligence Center.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:51.600
The Heavenly Intelligence Center?

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.440
What on earth is the Heavenly Intelligence Center?

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.920
Why did they catch you?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.940
Calm down, Princess.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.160
We have to follow the order.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.680
When the important criminal is caught,

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.240
we’ll definitely come back to apologize for the offence.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.480
That’s more like it.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.760
But I ask you to apologize right now.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.680
In this case,

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.360
don’t blame us on our attack, Princess.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.280
Seemingly, it’s because

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.190
they think I’m a traitor of the Heavenly Intelligence Center,

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.880
but in fact,

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.680
it’s because I know some secrets of the Heavenly Intelligence Center.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.960
Okay. I want neither to listen to it

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:18.840
nor to know it.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:20.240
Right now,

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:23.120
right now, I want to leave.

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:26.410
If you go out, you will to die.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.180
Why did you enter the world of Magicians?

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.080
I only want to be a bartender in Blessings Town,

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.420
to be a nobody.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.570
No, I have to help her.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.560
Didn’t you say you wanted to be a nobody?

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.800
But I should solve the current problem first.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:59.790
I made a Barrier.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.030
They can’t see you now.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:02.890
But the Barrier can only last for fifteen minutes.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.440
What on earth will you do?

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.310
That’s enough. Enough!

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.080
Rosemary!

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:30.780
It’s your turn.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.080
What happened?

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.160
Lord VII,

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.240
your new disciple

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.760
is trying to stop the Heavenly Intelligence Center from performing a mission.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:03.760
That’s impossible.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.130
He’s escaping from the hunting of the Marquis’.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.080
He’s with the traitor of the Heavenly Intelligence Center.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.390
What?

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.790
Run faster, please,

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.120
or we’ll kick the bucket.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:22.920
Kynil!

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.200
Marry with me, quickly.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.060
My lady,

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.340
it’s so urgent now.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.020
Can’t you stop talking about our wedding?

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.800
Life or marriage, which is more important?

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.310
You’re the one that the Heavenly Intelligence Center is hunting for.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.080
Not me, but him.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.150
Then it’s easy.

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.820
Go with me.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.540
Wait.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.820
Why are the young people nowadays so childish?

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.800
I don’t want to repeat.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:44.910
Kynil!

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:45.950
Tell her.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.080
What do you mean?

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.710
Listen:

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.650
He knew a great secret,

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:53.980
great enough for the Heavenly Intelligence Center to hunt him down at whatever cost.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.080
And then they’ll hunt you down, and then me.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.040
Understand?

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.640
Don’t you have a super powerful Beast?

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.530
Release it.

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:06.610
Forget it.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.280
He even can’t use his Power

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.620
in a proficient way.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.560
Then what can we do?
