00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.880
L.O.R.D. Critical World

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.740
Episode 8

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.039
Who are you?

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.200
Disciple of Lord II, Shen Yin.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.800
Disciple of Lord II?

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.880
You're disciple of slaughter!

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.080
How are you going to kill me?

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.560
Please hurry up!

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.039
Don't torture me anymore!

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.880
Just kill me!

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.079
Tian Xin.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.840
What happened?

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.880
How did you hurt so badly?

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.400
Stop it.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.560
Xue Li!

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.200
Please don't die.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.040
Xue Li!

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.800
Reya, are you happy now?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.640
You didn't forgive her after all.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.280
Of course.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.760
Seeing you killing your beloved woman,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.640
of course I'm happy.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.920
I thought

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.760
if I stole your mask,

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.240
they would not find you.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.520
But I never thought that

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.680
it was me who killed you at last.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.440
Am I allowed to die now?

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.480
It's been nice working with you.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.600
Although I received a Red Order to kill Tian Xin,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.240
I didn't have a chance to do it.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.760
That was enough.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.040
Tian Xin was one of my best disciples.

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.240
He is smart

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.720
and well trained.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.920
So he knew clearly about the rules

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.159
in the Heavenly Intelligence Center.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.000
I have to destroy his perception,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.280
then destroy his faith little by little

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.400
with the Distract Magic.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.280
And your appearance

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.280
destroyed it completely.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.240
So this was your plan all along

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.320
to make him puts an end to it himself?

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.200
Lord IV's work is really fascinating.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.400
All of my killing has purposes.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.920
Unlike your lord,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.960
who loves to kill.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.200
He's simple but horrific.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.240
Since Lord IV has cut the grass,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.800
there's one more thing I'd like to ask.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.159
Where can I find Lotus?

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.640
You know my rules.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.480
A secret for a secret.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.720
What do you want to know?

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.240
Do you know how to make different talents

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.240
fuse in the body?

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.640
I don't know.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.120
Take your time.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.840
Just keep it in mind.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.480
Someday, you'll have my answer.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.200
Fine.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.000
Do you have that attitude

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.040
even before Specter?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.400
Since Lotus hid in the Mound,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.800
maybe she's in

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.520
the passway of it.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920
Of course.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.840
Lord Reya,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.600
Lord VII Yin Chen

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.560
has left with two disciples.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.480
They trespassed the HIC,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.400
why did you let them go so easily?

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.240
Since Yin Chen came to save them personally,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.400
of course I would let him.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.080
How else can I get him on board?

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.640
One more thing,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.720
tell Rosemary to show her identity.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.720
Aye.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.280
My lord,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.880
who's buried here?

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.840
Tian Xin and his lover.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.120
Tian Xin's dead?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.560
You knew this was coming, why didn't you save him?

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.040
He said

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.320
it's destined.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.000
Since he betrayed the HIC,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.280
he'd know that he's going to die.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.480
It's just a matter of time.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.200
I asked him to save you and Rosemary,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.440
and for exchange,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.000
he wanted me to bury them together.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.040
Since Tian Xin's dead,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.120
my father's whereabouts become a mystery again.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.360
What was that?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.600
It's an Order from the HIC.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.880
A White Order!

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.920
Go to the Mound and get a Halidom.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.840
Great!

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.120
A Halidom!

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.280
I can have my own Halidom.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.800
The Magician was so powerful,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.640
but he died a horrible death.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.040
Yin Chen,

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.280
will a lord protect his disciple forever?

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.320
No.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.720
Then,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.120
What if I were in such a danger?

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.280
You didn't tell me about that

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.080
when you made me your disciple back then.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.360
I will protect you.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.600
But I can't promise to protect you forever.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.080
Destiny

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.760
is not a matter of choice.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.320
But I want to have other choices.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.480
It's not up to me to be your disciple.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.360
Besides,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.120
aren't disciples supposed to protect others?

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.640
How can it be dangerous to themselves?

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.000
If I had known,

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.520
I would not have been your disciple.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.600
How about this?

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.400
Let's go to the countryside

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.800
and run a small tavern.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.440
It may not make us a fortune,

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.640
but,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.000
be content with what you have,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.880
am I right?

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.240
Seriously.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.800
My dream was to have a big tavern.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.280
But it's always been a pipe dream.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.280
Do you remember Yang Ze?

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.200
He got separated from us back then.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.000
I ran into him some time earlier.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.400
As long as he's with us,

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.560
there's still hope.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.680
Yang Ze is gone.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.160
What do you mean?

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.600
Where did he go?

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.920
He's indeed a good friend.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.200
When you're caught in the HIC,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.520
he came all the way over here to ask for my help.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.240
See?

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.160
I knew it.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.000
Yang Ze was good to me.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.920
I see.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.480
He must went to his father to ask for money.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.280
It was me who told him to leave.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.080
You?

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.920
I also used Magic to get rid of him last time.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.880
And I've warned him

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.800
not to come looking for you again.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.640
Yang Ze is my friend.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.640
How can you do that!

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.840
I can't choose

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.080
my own destiny.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.520
Now I can't even

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.880
choose my friends?

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.240
Do you know

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.320
how much I want my own tavern?

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.960
I helped him before.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.440
I deserve that money.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:43.880
Right there.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.720
Of course.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.320
Yeah,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.440
that's right.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.720
You always have that look.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.360
Every Magician I met is the same.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.800
So arrogant.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.600
So cold.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.640
You think you're better than us?

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.080
Do you know what human emotion is?

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.840
Do you have any feelings?

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.400
From this point,

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.360
Tian Xin was so much better than you.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.360
I can't take it anymore.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.880
Tian Xin was right.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.840
We're going to die anyway.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.640
But,

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.080
I'd rather not die in the world of Magicians.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.320
It seems that

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.880
you're not ready to be a disciple.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.760
I can do it with my hands.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.760
What's with the Magic? What a show-off!

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.000
Hey, man.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.480
Is this your boat?

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.280
Was there a big ship just now?

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.440
Yeah, but it left.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.920
Did it go that way?

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.320
Come on! Let's go after it.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.720
Do you have any money?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.880
Of course!

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.680
Well...

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160
I'll pay you after we catch up with the ship.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.080
Nonsense!

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.400
Go away!

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.520
Please take care.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.400
Hope to see you next time.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.160
Welcome.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.280
Are you still hiring?

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.560
Don't judge me by my look.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.040
I know how to run a tavern since I was a boy.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.720
I'm quite experienced.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.480
I have five great qualities.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.320
I eat a little,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.840
but I'm very strong.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.840
I know how to solicit customers and brew.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.320
But most importantly,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.040
I'm a lady-killer.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.200
We're well-staffed,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.640
go look for a job somewhere else.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.360
Boss, is it ordered by table two?

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.000
Right.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.720
Serve it to table two.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.880
Hey! Wait!

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.520
Where is Kynil?

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.920
You're only Lord VII.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.760
Why being so arrogant?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.120
Well, I'm in a good mood today

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.520
and I'll forgive you for that.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.520
I received a White Order from the HIC today.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.360
It recognized my disciple identity.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:06.720
By the way,

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.480
I have something to take care of right now.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.320
When it's done,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.440
I'll come to the Imperial Capital with you guys.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.120
Kynil is already a big trouble,

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.880
if Your Highness wants to go to the Imperial Capital,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.160
please go by yourself.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.360
Now I need to take a rest.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.440
What's with that attitude?

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.640
I was being nice to

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.000
go to the Imperial Capital with you.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.280
It's Kynil who caused troubles,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.560
why blame me?

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.960
Even if I'm a disciple,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.080
I'm disciple of Lord VI.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.400
You're as blind as a bat.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.160
You'll be sorry one day.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.080
Boss,

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.400
what do you think?

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.680
Am I capable for the job?

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.280
I will give you another half day.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:00.960
For free.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.960
Boss, I want some roast beef, one roast chicken,

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.800
a bowl of braised pork,

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.069
and a steamed fish, big and fresh.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:07.040
Serve quickly.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.960
You?

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:17.720
Sorry, Lady.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.160
About the food you just ordered,

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.480
I suggest you replace the roast chicken with roast duck,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.800
then change the big fish into a bigger one.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.069
Cut it out.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.200
Aren't you supposed to be

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.480
with your Lord Yin Chen?

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:27.560
Why are you here?

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.240
What is the purpose of you?

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.880
Don't mention him to me.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.120
It's none of your business.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.600
It's all because you that I can't go to the Imperial Capital.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.600
You can't go to the Imperial Capital,

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.920
what's it got to do with me?

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.280
Go argue with him.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.400
No.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.040
I want to go to the Imperial Capital right now.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.800
Go find Yin Chen with me now.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.000
I don't care.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.880
I'm telling you,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.040
I have nothing to do with that man.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.760
How can you say that?

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.200
I will tell you again,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.440
I've already broken off with that man.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.400
If you dare to made me lose this job,

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.640
I won't let you off.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.080
Oh, really?

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.480
If I can't go to the Imperial Capital,

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.640
you can't have a job, either.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.120
What...

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.040
Why are you still following me?

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.360
Why did you meddle with my business?

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.480
Why did you do that to me?

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.480
It's all because you that I can't go to the Imperial Capital.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.840
That's why.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.160
If you are so great, just go by yourself.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.480
Why do you want Yin Chen's help?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.840
Moreover,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.160
If it wasn't for you to go to the HIC,

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.640
we wouldn't get into such a mess.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.120
I'm telling you,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.600
go to the Windy Restaurant with me right now

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.480
and explain everything clearly,

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.040
then we'll be even.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.160
So annoying.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.520
What...

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.000
Don't test me! I don't fight with girls!

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.680
I can't even control myself when I get angry!

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.080
Stop your nonsense. Just bring it!

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.160
Don't come over.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.120
Ice Fang!

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.800
Kynil,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.040
come out!

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.040
No, I won't.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.320
I'd rather not.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.760
Kynil,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.160
come on.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.560
Don't mess with me.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.000
Did you feel it too?

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.240
Is Kynil in danger?

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.840
What is this place? Am I on the hill?

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.680
Why is everything so weird?

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.640
Hello? Is anyone here?

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.160
Is that a girl?

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.520
Hey!

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.360
Were you attacked by these blood vessels?

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.320
I will help you drive them away.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.520
Forget it.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.800
It's none of my business.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.960
Use fire

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.480
to get rid of the blood vessels.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.480
They have the Power of Water

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.920
and they hate fire.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.520
I am going after them.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.560
Don't.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.000
Just drive them away.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.360
Don't hurt them.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.280
They are gone.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.120
Are you trapped by the ice barrier?

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.480
Shall I break it and get you out of there?

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.520
Don't.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.840
The blood vessels are attracted by the smell of my blood.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.640
If you break the ice barrier,

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.240
they will show up again.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.160
You should go.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.840
Don't mind me.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.840
How can I

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.600
leave a girl in the middle of nowhere?

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.960
What disciple are you?

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.640
How does she know that I am a disciple?

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.280
How did you know that?

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.400
This is the Mound.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.560
Only disciples and lords who do not have a Halidom

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.160
can come in here.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.480
So this is the Mound.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.400
Then you must be a disciple, too.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.640
I can't leave you alone.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.280
I know!

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.000
I have Ice Fang.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:52.800
It can fly.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.760
I will take you out.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.440
Just open the ice barrier.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.480
My Power can come back to me in the Mound.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.920
Focus.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.840
Don't fly too high.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.880
Find an open place and put me down first.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.200
Ice Fang,

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.360
fly.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.800
Thank you.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.280
You are welcome.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.080
We are both disciples,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.760
of course we should help each other.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.240
I'm a disciple of Lord V.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.480
My name is Lotus.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.200
Lotus.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.760
Such a beautiful name.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.520
Over there.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.680
Is this Ice Fang?

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.560
It's an excellent Beast.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.960
Actually,

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.000
you seem to be

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.680
the first person riding it.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.800
I'm honored.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.640
She's talking about you.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.720
I need a little time to heal.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.960
Do you want me to help?

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.480
Kynil.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.760
Kynil.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.760
Why are you here?

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.600
Why are you here?

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.760
You said there's something to take care of,

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.880
was it to go to the Mound and get a Halidom?

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.080
Do you know by which portal can we get in the Mound?

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.240
Wow! You are amazing!

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.080
You healed so fast.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.720
Lords and disciples use the Power to heal.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.880
That's normal.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.680
Comparing to the Immortal Talent,

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.840
it's nothing.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.880
The blood vessels just attacked us,

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.240
what is it?

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.080
I'm not sure.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.880
But I sensed

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.160
the Power of Water in them.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.600
The blood vessels are connected to each other.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.360
I'm afraid if one gets hurt,

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.040
it will cause some trouble.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.200
I don't know what they are.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.400
Maybe you think too much.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.760
Still, you can't be too careful.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.360
You're right.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.200
Did you just attack me with ice?

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.320
I was protecting you.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.960
I'm afraid that you would hurt the blood vessels,

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.200
so I drew the blood vessels to me.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.720
You're so nice.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.240
They came at me anyway.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.720
Thank you

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.080
for helping me so much.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.360
By the way,

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.480
have you got your Halidom?

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.840
No. You?

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.080
No.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.800
Then do you know which one to take?

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.600
Who knows?

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.000
I'll just

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.520
take a nice one.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.840
Your lord didn't tell you

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.240
what Halidom you should take?

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.000
So that's how it works.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.760
Yin Chen

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.360
didn't tell me anything.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.360
I don't know what's on his mind all day long.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.040
Every disciple can only go into the Mound once.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.000
Even if you don't know what Halidom you should take,

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.400
you have to take one.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.640
Otherwise, there will be no chance in the future.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.160
What Halidom are you going to take?

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.840
I'm going to take the one

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.080
called the Resurgence Chain.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.320
I think it's easy to get.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.680
What about you?

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.320
What should I do?

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.320
I can use this.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.240
I see.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.720
You can use the Golden Fruit

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.200
to find the most powerful Halidom and take it away.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.640
That's right.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.320
This one is for you.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.280
I have another one.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.720
That Yin Chen!

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.000
He doesn't tell me anything!

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.960
What do you blame your lord for?

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.480
It's your temper

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.160
that makes him headache.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.680
He didn't tell me anything.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.560
He has a long face every day.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.400
I don't know what he's thinking.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.880
It surprised me that

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.280
Lord VII Yin Chen took a disciple.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.640
Do you know my lord?

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.240
What kind of person is he?

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.880
Why is he always alone?

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.880
He has never had disciples.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.040
It was also the arrangement of the Silver Priest.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.400
So,

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.760
he is unwilling to

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.720
take me as his disciple.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.000
This is embarrassing.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.160
Don't you know

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.520
what the disciple means to a lord?

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.320
It means one day

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.680
he will give his own destiny

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.200
to the disciple unreservedly,

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.560
and the disciple can inherit it.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.200
If he doesn't trust you,

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.720
how can he give you his lord mark?

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.040
Well,

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.160
he never told me about it.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.480
That's because you didn't tell him

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.880
that you want to know about these things.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.280
I want to hurry to find the spirit to leave this now.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.080
Disciple of Lord VI Rosemary,

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.000
can I ask you for a favor?

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:02.720
Alright.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.400
Tell me about it.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.240
I'm only a disciple of Lord VI,

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.200
how can I help Lord VII?

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.920
Please tell Kynil that

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.360
the Halidom he'd take is¡­

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.040
It's a dead end.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.120
What should we do?

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.440
Is that your Beast?

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.720
So big.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.680
Go ahead.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.080
See what's on the other side?

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.680
It's so fast.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.720
What is its name?

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.000
It's Eagle.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.720
Talents of Lord V and disciples

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.240
are riding the Beast

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.840
and exchanging Beasts and Halidoms with others.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.840
My brother's Beast Silver Dragon

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
is a gift from me.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.400
I grew up with Beasts,

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.320
they're like family to me.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.360
That's nice.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.880
I wish I could have a Lord like a brother to me.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.230
But my Lord,

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.230
he didn't even tell me

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.320
what Halidom to take in the Mound.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.080
Actually,

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.560
I just quarreled with my Lord,

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.080
and I ran out.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.230
I came in here by accident.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.400
So it's you

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.840
who acted like a kid

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.400
in front of your Lord,

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.000
am I right?

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.120
I acted like a kid?

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.400
He is as cold as an iceberg.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.560
It's not possible.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.920
Here it is!

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.280
Did you find the exit?

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.200
Let's take a ride on Eagle.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.320
Really?

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.960
Can I ride your Beast?

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.600
I've never ridden someone else's Beast.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.960
Finally.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.840
My brother and I are blood-related.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.280
But since he became my Lord,

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.640
I feel

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.040
different.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.000
I understand him better,

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.080
and I can feel his emotions.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.240
You mean the bond between the Lord and the disciple

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.640
is stronger than blood relationships?

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.200
Indeed.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.480
Tell me,

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.120
do you really think that your Lord is cold and detached?

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.400
Then why is that when he said some cold words

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.040
and you're not mad at him?

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.160
And after you met,

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:22.280
you had an inexplicable emotion and trust in him.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.440
Am I right?

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.880
I don't know.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.400
Alright, don't comfort me.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.600
I know I came in here by myself.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.600
But,

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.800
isn't he supposed to come and save me?

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.720
I don't even know what Halidom to take now.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.280
Maybe I just take a rock or whatever.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.320
Stop acting like a kid.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.280
A lord and his disciple share the same route of power flow,

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.200
as long as you concentrate on it,

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.760
you can feel him.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.360
And the pain and anxiety in your body

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.080
can also be felt by your Lord

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.440
no matter where he is.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.800
He must be worried about you

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.360
and is trying to help you.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.440
Can he really feel it?

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:06.760
Then,

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.000
when I fell into the Mound,

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.640
my head was swimming.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.560
And,

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.760
my Mark of a Lord felt a sting.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.320
Does that mean he felt me then?

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.560
I think

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.680
Lord Yin Chen must have known

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.240
you strayed into the Mound.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.360
It's just that he couldn't come in again,

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.120
so he can't help you now.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.840
Hold on.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.280
I've already told you how to get the Halidom

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.240
and how to get out of the Mound.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.680
I also told you

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.720
the risks and shortcuts in there.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.920
Your Lord is not around.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.840
So you wouldn't know if it weren't for me.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.000
In exchange,

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.560
I hope that you can help me with one thing.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.440
Just tell these

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.480
to Kynil.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.800
Make sure he gets his Halidom

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.280
and come out safely.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.960
My lord is not around.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.440
But after I find him,

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.160
he will tell me everything.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.880
If that's what it is,

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.040
then he would teach you

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.720
manners of a disciple.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.760
Now you are asking me for a favor.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.080
It seems that you don't know your position clearly.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.560
Kynil just went into the Mound by accident,

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.400
why are you so worried?

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.520
The silent Yin Chen

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.960
talked so much to me

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.160
just to save his little disciple.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.880
It must be hard for you.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.080
Well,

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.960
I just want to see

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.560
how important is a little disciple to you?

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.800
What do you want?

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.800
I want you

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:07.920
to kneel

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.240
and beg me to save your disciple.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.000
I knew it.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.640
Both of you are the same.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.120
You only want to take advantage

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.640
but would pay nothing.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.600
If you can't take this one,

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.160
of course you rank low.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.080
That's alright.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.680
If I don't go into the Mound,

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.000
it's not a big deal.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.760
Just your Kynil can't get out of there.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.880
Deal?

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.720
Then I'm leaving.
