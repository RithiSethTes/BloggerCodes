00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.360
I can hardly pay my workers now.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.720
I don't care.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.920
Even if you don't have the money,

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.640
your fur coat

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.960
is worth more than a hundred silver taels.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:41.880
You're wrong.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.720
An expensive steed

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.640
and a costly fur coat.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.880
My coat

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.600
was made

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.920
by Yuxiu Boutique in Tianqi City.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.320
It took three months to make it

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.040
and

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.600
another month to deliver it to me.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.280
One hundred silver taels?

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.720
That's not even enough for my sleeves.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.560
You...

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.400
So,

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.960
did you get my message now?

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.440
Two silver taels.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.640
What two silver taels?

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.200
This table

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.800
costs two silver taels.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.760
You...

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.320
I'm here to rob you.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.400
Not to eat.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.920
Give me the best liquor

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:22.960
and the best meat.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.760
Then, hand me whatever is worthy.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.840
Otherwise,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.240
I'll kill your people

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.320
and burn your inn.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.240
A robbery?

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.200
I have to intervene then.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.920
Who are you?

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.240
Lei Wujie.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.000
Lei Wujie?

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:39.840
That's right.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.200
Who?

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:44.960
No idea.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.720
Who is Lei Wujie?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.640
Never heard of him.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.600
Does he ring a bell?

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.200
I just started to travel the martial arts world,

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.360
so naturally, you don't

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.080
know my name.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.320
However,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.800
it's no matter.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.080
Soon,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.160
my name will...

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.200
Just a nameless brat.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:02.840
Hit him!

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.040
The weaponless.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.960
Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect?

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:26.800
The Lei Clan?

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.840
I'm Lei Wujie

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.800
of the Lei family.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.120
Kill him!

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.680
That was my Formless Fist.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:23.520
Of course,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:24.880
I have something

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.840
more impressive.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.160
♪Pursuing the dream of our youth♪

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.160
♪We take everything as it comes♪

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.160
♪The distant land might be dangerous♪

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.920
♪But what's life without an adventure?♪

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.000
♪Youths are supposed to dream big and be sharp♪

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.400
♪Every struggle in life has taught us♪

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.040
♪That we shall do what we can wherever we go♪

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.360
♪Together, another journey awaits♪

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.320
So?

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.240
Do you know who I am now?

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.360
Get lost now.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.160
Let's go.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.840
Come on.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.400
You're welcome.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.600
I have to intervene.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.920
It's my duty.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:35.880
So no need to thank me.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.320
I have to go now.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.160
May we meet again.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.920
No need to thank you?

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.960
You have to intervene?

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.320
Of course.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.720
If it weren't for me,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.320
those bandits

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.520
would have trashed your inn.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.520
You might have lost your life too.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.760
Shouldn't you thank me?

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.560
Look at my inn.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.440
Is it not trashed already?

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.240
Well...

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.600
One hundred silver taels.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.080
I don't have money.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:13.480
But...

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.240
Either way,

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.360
I did save your life.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.560
You're just...

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.960
Do I look like I need your help?

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.040
This technique...

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.960
One hundred silver taels.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.640
I really don't have money.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:30.440
You don't?

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.040
But I

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:31.760
will have money soon.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.120
I just have to go to this place.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.560
Then, I'll have money.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.280
What place?

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.320
Xueyue City.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.280
Xueyue City?

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.200
(Xueyue City.)

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.520
(The biggest city in the martial arts world.)

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.680
(It houses the alliance formed by several)

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.600
(prestigious clans.)

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.920
(Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect)

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.320
(is one of them.)

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.640
(To reclaim what is mine,)

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.800
(I have to visit)

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.320
(that city too.)

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.920
(If he)

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.240
(is visiting the city too,)

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.200
(knowing his identity,)

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.440
(he can easily)

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.800
(procure 100 silver taels)

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.240
(for me.)

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.200
(And he)

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.520
(doesn't look like he's lying either.)

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.600
(Honestly,)

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.280
(he might know one powerful technique or two,)

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.920
(but he still looks like an idiot.)

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:27.520
Sure.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.640
You're visiting Xueyue City.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.000
And I'll go with you.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.590
No problem.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:33.720
Also,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:35.720
as for the interest rate,

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.800
let's make it 500 silver taels.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.560
Five hundred?

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.080
(I have stayed at this place for many years.)

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.760
(The meeting with those several city lords)

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.720
(is long overdue too.)

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.920
(Time to revisit what happened that year.)

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.720
The freshly fermented wine is sprinkled
with green foam

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.880
while the red clay pot slowly burns.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.800
A snowfall is impending.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.120
Would you care to drink with me?

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.560
I like your proposition,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.080
so I would gladly drink with you.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.160
However, this horse carriage

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.560
will stay here.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.240
Do you know

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.440
what it

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.920
contains?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.400
Valuables.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.920
You

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.280
are not wrong per se.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:42.920
Enough.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.720
Hand it over now.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.080
Otherwise...

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.920
[Tang Lian, Xueyue City]
You followed me

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.720
in this heavy snow.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.640
I feel bad for you.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.720
But your endeavor

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.520
is destined to fail.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.880
I think

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.320
you should drink with me first

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.840
and...

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.200
Finger dagger.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.160
Perhaps, your client

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.000
didn't tell you

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.400
who I am.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:28.960
This payload

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.440
will not be intercepted

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.640
by the likes of you.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.040
You're from the Tang Clan of Shu?

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:17.960
I wonder

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.280
what Master asked me to deliver.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.200
It

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.240
has attracted so many powerful foes.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:38.680
Who's there?

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.200
Tang Lian...

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.240
of Xueyue City.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.160
You know my name.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.760
We will meet again.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.320
Stop right there.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.160
What an eccentric person.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.080
A white-haired man with a jade sword
and exceptional qinggong techniques.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.880
Master never told me

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.280
of such a person.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.160
It snows so heavily.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.320
When will it

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.200
stop?

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.520
Fortunately,

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.000
my horse is a fine steed.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.080
Otherwise,

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.160
we will be buried under the snow.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.080
Wait.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.040
You keep telling me

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.760
how well your horse performs.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.160
Are you a horse seller?

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.160
Cut the crap.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.600
Go in and start a fire.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.400
Pretentious.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.440
Someone was here.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:10.960
Great.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.200
That's convenient.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.320
I was worried that the firewood

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.520
would be too wet for it.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.000
(Just two)

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.240
(ordinary travelers then?)

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.200
Hurry up.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.080
Lei Wujie.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.200
You said you would bring me to Xueyue City.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.480
But you

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.080
have taken two wrong turns so far.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.320
Are you sure we're heading in the right direction?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.840
It's actually my first time

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.720
visiting Xueyue City.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:51.840
But I swear

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.840
I got it right this time.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.080
(His last name is Lei.)

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.320
(Is he)

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.480
(from the Lei family
of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect?)

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.800
(But Lei Wujie...)

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.320
(I have never heard of him.)

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.200
Is dog your Chinese zodiac sign?

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.480
What are you sniffing?

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.560
Did you smell something?

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.400
What smell?

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:23.720
A floral scent.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.800
It's baby rose.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.200
Baby rose?

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.600
It doesn't bloom during winter.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.270
It's a scent of baby rose dew.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.560
Baby rose dew.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.520
From Taziks,

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.400
Champa, and Java.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.240
Only the Baihua Perfumery

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.800
in Tianqi City sells it.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.320
You shouldn't find it here.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.360
I didn't expect to come across

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.120
a man of fine taste in this secluded place.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.040
I implored the owner of Baihua Perfumery
for many days

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.920
before she sold it to me.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.000
And you detected it right away.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.560
It's breezy and chilly.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.160
Do you want to come in?

00:22:59.480 --> 00:22:59.960
No need.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.080
This is...

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.600
[Death]

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.400
[Yueji]
Yueji greets

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.640
and Minghou kills.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.960
[Minghou]

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.200
That's right.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.440
That's right!

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.120
What is right?

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.160
They

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.200
are Yueji and Minghou.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.920
Ranked ninth in the League of Assassins.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.960
The first eight places

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.480
are occupied by members of Dark River.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.880
So they

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.640
are the strongest killer duo
in the martial arts world at the moment.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:33.880
In that case,

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.680
they just greeted us,

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.440
so are they going...

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.480
They are going to kill us.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.200
Why are you so excited?

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.520
That was to greet

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.720
another friend inside.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.880
However, our rule is

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.400
that whoever accepts the card will have to die.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.640
So please

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.480
die here.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.640
I accepted your card once,

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.520
but here I am.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.880
May I know your name?

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.360
Tang Lian.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.400
That's why we're here

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.200
to kill you.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.040
Tang Lian?

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.400
You're Tang Lian?

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.040
The most outstanding disciple of Xueyue City?

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.120
In that case,

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.000
you're my eldest martial brother.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.040
I'm Lei Wujie.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.240
From the Lei Fortress

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.200
of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.000
I'm also a disciple.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:31.760
Careful.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.840
Minghou is reticent.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.160
He hates blabbermouth.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.040
Such a huge blade.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.200
You're injured.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.280
And your Baixiang poison

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.160
hasn't been treated either.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.200
Otherwise, the slash from just now...

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:09.960
You won't be able

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.040
to take the next hit.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.000
Then I will.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.720
My martial brother protected me once.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.640
So it's my turn now.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.240
You

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.440
serve Xueyue City too?

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.920
Then I can kill you too.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.680
However, Minghou's claymore isn't for everyone,

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.640
so have a taste of my sword first.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.440
Belt Sword?

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.400
They have matching

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.240
weapons.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.040
Belt Sword

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.080
and the Golden Claymore.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.800
Not many can see

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.320
these two weapons in one night.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.080
Watch closely now, young man.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.840
They say the Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.760
has the best firearms.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.040
But your inner force

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.120
is not too shabby either.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.760
You could catch my sword

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.880
with your bare hands.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.520
I have seen your sword,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.720
but you haven't seen

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.960
my fist.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.440
The Formless First of the Lei Clan.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.160
The pressure wave arrives before the fist does.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.320
He

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.360
is strong.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.400
Lunar Thrust, Shadow Disguise.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.680
They are strong techniques for assassination.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.160
But what good are they

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.800
if they can't

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.320
eliminate the target?

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:24.800
I lost.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.320
You won

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.640
just now.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.440
You must be joking.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.400
For an assassin, there's no winning or losing,

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.880
only living and dying.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.840
I just entered the martial arts world

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.320
and I could fight an opponent like you.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.120
How lucky am I?

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.160
This is...

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.960
Fire Infusion from the Lei family.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.920
(No wonder his hair turns red.)

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:51.720
Yueji.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.360
Let's go.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.160
You're leaving already?

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:39.920
How odd.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.480
They had the upper hand.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.680
Why did they leave?

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.160
If you charge at any attack thrown at you,

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.320
you won't have

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.160
enough lives to live.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.680
You can fight too.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.760
Why didn't you help me?

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.360
When did I say

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.120
I could fight?

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:54.600
But

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.800
you waved your hand

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.800
in your inn

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.360
and all windows and doors shut on their own.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:29:59.760
Idiot.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.000
Other than martial arts,

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.600
there's also something called a mechanism.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.600
Do I look like I need your help?

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.720
What?

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.240
Mister.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:16.560
Did you hide something

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.480
in the backyard?

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.600
Someone snuck in there.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.160
I think Minghou and Yueji

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.520
knew they were being

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.520
used as bait.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.270
Let's go.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.000
Why?

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.840
Aren't we going to Xueyue City?

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.360
The First Disciple of Xueyue City

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.240
is in front of us.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.480
I'd rather follow him

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:41.960
than your lousy lead.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.200
Right.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.240
Only cowards

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.200
would pull a dirty trick like this.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.920
I beg your pardon, Tang Lian?

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.840
Who is a coward here?

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.000
Protect my eldest martial brother!

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.400
Qianluo.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.120
Does Third Master know you're here?

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.960
Don't tell me you snuck out.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.840
Of course not.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.400
I'm on an adventure now,

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.040
and I merely passed by here.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.720
What is happening?

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.160
She snuck out.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.200
I have a task at hand.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.800
I will write to Third Master and ask him

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.040
to bring you back.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:37.600
[Sikong Qianluo]
How dare you, Tang Lian.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.760
Lian.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:54.840
Fine.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.880
We will settle this in the future.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:07.560
Tang Lian.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.600
Just you wait!

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.240
She is...?

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:12.720
Sikong Qianluo.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.720
Sikong.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.520
The daughter

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.600
of the Spear Deity, Sikong Changfeng?

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.760
Yes, she's my Third Master's daughter.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.080
Also the Young Lady of Xueyue City.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.680
What a surprise.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.120
Qianluo...

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:33.360
went overboard this time.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:48.760
What are you doing?

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.200
The sound doesn't lie.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.080
It's pure gold.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:32:59.840
Pure gold?

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.440
So?

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.960
It's worth a lot of money.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.080
We just met

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.960
and you would trust us already?

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.800
I don't trust you.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.720
I trust him.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.120
Well,

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.160
we share the same opinion.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.480
He

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.720
has the techniques

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.840
but not the brain.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.280
He is incapable

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.520
of lying.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:38.800
And you?

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:39.640
Me?

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.200
I gave you my two best

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.120
Yebei Steed

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.600
to pull the carriage.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:44.960
Is that not enough?

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.160
Martial Brother.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.320
Ignore him.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.840
He's just a horse merchant.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:49.840
He keeps saying

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.280
how good his horses are

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.000
and nothing else.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.040
Lei.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.320
You're not one of the disciples.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.720
So please refrain

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:58.880
from using

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.120
martial brother

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:00.960
to call me.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.640
Sure, Martial Brother.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.600
So you don't know

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.880
what the coffin contains?

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.080
Master didn't tell me.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.160
He just told me to escort it

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.360
to Jiulong Sect of Biluo City.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:14.760
Besides,

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.920
he also told me...

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.280
Told you what?

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:19.960
Do not ever

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.280
open this coffin.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.840
Now,

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:29.960
you make me

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:30.920
all curious.

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.800
Don't be.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.280
I have run into

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.760
more than ten groups of assassins.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:36.760
Many people

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.960
are coveting its content.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.560
Possessing it

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.560
brings misfortune.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.480
So your wounds

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.560
came from those people.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.160
(No, from Yueji and Minghou.)

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.520
(Others)

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.400
(are just...)

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.200
I have heard

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.560
the rumor

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.840
of the Golden Coffin.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.320
What have you heard?

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.360
Don't look at me like that.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.240
The rumor

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.840
is already spreading.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.520
There are all sorts of rumors.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.200
But in general,

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.240
someone is delivering the Golden Coffin

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.880
from Hanshui Temple to the border.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.280
The coffin contains

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.840
boundless valuables

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.720
and powerful martial arts

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.560
to rule the world.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.080
Do you believe it?

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.280
I didn't.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.320
But when I see

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.320
the First Disciple of Xueyue City,

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.240
Tang Lian, escorting

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.080
the Golden Coffin...

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.920
So what?

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.560
To circulate

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.920
this rumor widely,

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.520
someone

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.040
has to make an effort.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.240
Assassins like Minghou and Yueji

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.120
can't

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.600
achieve that.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.120
I'm sure you also heard

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.520
that several months ago,

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.440
Abbot Wangyou of Hanshui Temple passed away.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.440
I bet his body

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.960
is in the coffin.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.480
But why do so many people

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.600
want it?

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.320
Who exactly are you?

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.280
I'm just

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.040
an innkeeper

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.280
who knows many things.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.280
So where are we going?

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.920
Jiulong Sect?

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.680
Belle's Manor of Three-Gaze City.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.280
Three gazes.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.080
The first gaze makes the city fall for the beauty.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.920
The second gaze brings the nation to its knee.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.200
The third gaze steals my heart.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.200
To go to Biluo City, we will definitely pass by

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:35.960
Three-Gaze City.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.240
Many merchants

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.160
pass by here every year,

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.280
many of which

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.360
are huge gamblers.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.720
Belle's Manor

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.160
is the biggest gambling den in the city.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.360
[Belle's Manor]

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.440
It is a brothel

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.160
and one of the few

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.640
gambling houses...

00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.240
In Beili.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.200
Unfortunately,

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.320
Lei Wujie

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.280
is on guard duty now.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.960
Otherwise, we should bring him here

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.720
to show him the real world.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.800
Belle's Manor is the biggest brothel

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.880
in Three-Gaze City.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:13.840
Its patrons

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.840
are the rich among the rich.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.520
They gamble with

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.840
astronomical figures
that normal chips won't cut it.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.240
Therefore, they gamble

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.760
in pearl boxes.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.240
We're already here anyway.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.520
Should we have a round?

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.040
I don't have money.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.240
Really?

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.640
We

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.720
have a pure gold coffin.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:38.840
Hush.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:40.600
I'm warning you.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.880
Don't ever think about that.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.040
I'm here

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.280
to seek my liaison.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.600
So avoid unnecessary attention.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.640
It's Fairy Rui!

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.280
[Fairy Rui, Belle's Manor]

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.160
Isn't this Lian?

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.320
Didn't you say

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.800
we should avoid unnecessary attention?

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.880
But look,

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.480
all eyes

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.800
are on us.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:45.520
Rui.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.200
Lian.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.440
It's been 16 months

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:52.680
and 7 days

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.160
since your last visit.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.280
How cold-hearted of you.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.040
Rui

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.840
and Lian.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.520
It sounds

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.520
like an old couple.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.400
A dashing lad, you are.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.000
I heard

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.120
you said you wanted a round.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.800
And tonight,

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.160
there's a rare game going on here.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.680
Do you want to play?

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.440
I don't have money.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.000
No.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.040
You have money.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.960
How do you know, miss?

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.480
A commoner

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.840
will gawk

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.560
in a huge gambling house like this one

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.960
and will fawn

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.080
over a beauty like me.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:34.840
But you

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.280
look so disinterested.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.600
As if the overwhelming beauty

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.240
and riches here

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.760
are nothing

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.600
but common occurrences to you.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.320
So,

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.160
aren't you rich?

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:49.880
Rui.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.640
We don't have time for this.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.280
Your liaison has not arrived,

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.200
but everything is ready.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:00.800
Be careful.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.360
Many top assassins

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.360
visit Three-Gaze City

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.400
for

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.480
the item.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.520
Some of them

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.880
can be quite tricky to handle.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.240
Mister, do you still fancy a game?

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.560
I own an inn

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.960
called Snowfall.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.440
It's worth 10 pearl boxes.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.080
Miss,

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.320
would you lend me them then?

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.160
Sure.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.400
This gentleman

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.680
has reserved the entire Belle's Manor tonight.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.360
If you want to gamble, you stay.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.760
If you don't want to gamble, please leave.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.960
You must be joking, Fairy Rui.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.520
Two pearl boxes

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.000
are enough to reserve the entire manor?

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.520
He looks

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.880
like a first-timer,

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.160
so he doesn't know the rules here.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.880
But not you too, Fairy Rui.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.240
You think so?

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.280
What mistake did I commit?

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.040
Come on.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.680
It's all a scare tactic.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.680
Why did I do that?

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:29.880
Because I want

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.880
everyone here to know

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.480
that the stake for this round

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.200
isn't just money.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.400
You mean...

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:37.800
Life too?

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:38.960
Yes.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.200
Gambling with your life...

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.360
What does she mean?

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.200
I'm sure you can guess it already.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.400
The loser will lose money

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.000
and his life.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:52.880
When did I

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.600
agree to that?

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.760
I know

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.000
you're protecting

00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.440
your beau here.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.320
But you should know

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.920
that this manor

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.040
won't be enough.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.280
It's you.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.440
We meet again,

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.400
Tang Lian.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.600
But she is right.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.680
If you want to play, you stay.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.800
If not,

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.800
you leave.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.320
Let's go now.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.560
Hand over it now.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:30.480
Now!

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.080
Interesting.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.240
They

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.560
[Lu Yuzhai, Wushuang City]
don't even know

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.760
what the Golden Coffin contains.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.960
Hand it out now.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.320
And they just have to meddle in this.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.640
Hurry up now!

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.240
