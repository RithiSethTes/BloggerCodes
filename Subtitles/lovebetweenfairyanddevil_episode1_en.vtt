Legend has it that

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.620
in order to acquire ancient forbidden skills,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.940
Dongfang Qingcang, the Moon Supreme of the Moon Tribe,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.380
became a monster

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.050
without any feelings.

He killed his father,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.540
took the position of the Moon Supreme,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.620
and led 100000 soldiers of the Moon Tribe

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.220
to burn, kill and loot.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.500
The fairy realm (Shuiyuntian), the Moon Tribe (Cangyan Sea)

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.580
and the mortal world (Yunmeng Lake)

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.420
were in grave danger.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.820
In order to save the common people,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.900
Chidi woman, the God of War of fairy realm,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.620
even destroyed her primordial spirit

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.380
to die with Dongfang Qingcang

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.100
and sealed 100,000 demon soldiers of the Moon Tribe.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.260
But the primordial spirit of Dongfang Qingcang

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.620
didn't die.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.460
Once he is resurrected,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.500
the three realms will be in danger again.

Legend has it that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.140
only the Goddess of Xishan

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.620
can defuse this catastrophe.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.940
But she

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.990
These are not ordinary leaves.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.990
They're Destiny Books.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.950
Every leaf tells

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.590
the fate of a person.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.710
And my duty

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.710
is to organize and take care of these books.

We won't interfere in anyone's fate.

In front of misfortune,

is me.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.430
Since she accidentally spoiled

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.830
my immortal root with wine,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.590
my cultivation and power have always been bad.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.030
After teaching me the skills,

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.750
my master left for the mortal world

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.710
and hasn't come back for 500 years.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.310
Even though

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.340
I'm a little lonely

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.830
in Arbiter Hall alone,

life

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.350
is not bad.

I'm getting better at repairing Destiny Books.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.780
I never burn the midnight oil.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.510
And there's not much to clean,

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.950
so I'm not tired.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.590
The flowers have enlightened their wisdom.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.350
They can chat with me.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.830
Don't sleep.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.430
Only by cultivating hard can you become

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.659
a fairy like me as soon as possible.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.510
It's early. Let me sleep more.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.830
What's so good about being like you?

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.990
You do so much work.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.030
It's better to be a grass.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.260
The other fairies

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.590
also treat me well.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.550
You even hid the portrait of Lord Changheng.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.830
You are so shameless.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.140
No one bullies me.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.310
Even we can't

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.270
talk to Lord Changheng.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.670
Lord Changheng will never look at you in this life.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.830
I plan to take the immortal examination

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.110
and go to Fountain Palace

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.790
to repay Lord Changheng.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.430
What is Orchid looking at?

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.470
Nothing but

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.230
her Lord Changheng.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.390
That portrait was torn.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.670
Why does she keep looking at that all day?

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.310
What does Lord Changheng look like

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.670
that makes Orchid so fascinated?

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.790
He is the God of War,

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.470
a bigwig.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.830
We never saw him.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.750
How did Lord Changheng

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.180
become her savior?

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.270
Could this be a dream of Orchid?

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.950
Repairing Destiny Books is not hard,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.030
but complex.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.950
A man's fate

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.030
can be affected by any small thing.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.230
One false step will

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.310
make a great difference.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.110
In my master's words,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.460
it's more complicated.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.909
A man's life is doomed.

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:53.790
Everything is circulation of karma.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.590
The karma

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.470
will never be depleted.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.150
I can repair 50 books a day.

1,500 each month.

When I repair 50000,

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.270
I'll write a letter of resignation to master.

Although Xunfeng

his golden body was intact

It was called Haotian Matrix.

This matrix has gathered all immortals' power.

In terms of strength,

no one in the three realms can destroy it.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.910
Then what's wrong with Haotian Tower?

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.470
Although Dongfang Qingcang had

lost consciousness,

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.160
I was going to buy some pills

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.600
after transforming.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.970
But now,

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:35.880
you can take them all.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.160
Creeper, thank you.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.370
By the way,

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.890
their case-dough

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:46.930
is there too.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.800
Creeper, you bastard.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.770
Orchid.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.880
Don't take mine.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.440
No words can express my thanks.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.170
After I pass the immortal examination

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.280
and become an immortal maid,

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.600
my salary will belong to you.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.200
Great.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.360
With these spirit stones, I can buy elixir.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.440
That is Lord Changheng's Destiny Book.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.240
It's weird.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.920
Destiny of a god is almost settled.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.360
Why would it change?

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:00.800
Why would it

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.640
break?

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.320
Oh no.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.250
Lord Changheng

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.080
will be in danger of dying out tonight.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.930
The time came.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.330
All immortals,

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.650
we have to strengthen the seal

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:18.530
in a quarter.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:19.560
No mistake is allowed.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.400
Yes.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.050
Yes.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.010
I've always been doing good works

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:50.250
and didn't do anything evil.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.170
I don't wish I would make a fortune.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.450
I only hope I could fix my immortal root

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.840
and have a peaceful life.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.550
I won't die out today, right?

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.050
It's okay.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.000
With so many senior immortals,

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.490
Lord Changheng will be fine.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.690
Life Line of Lord Changheng still breaks.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.010
It looks exactly the same as what I saw in Destiny Book.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.560
What should I do?

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.690
It's almost midnight.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.120
My dear disciple, remember this.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.730
The master of Destiny Books can

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.520
neither tell anything about it to its owner,

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.170
nor change anyone's fate.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.890
Otherwise, he would have to bear the wrath of God.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.410
bear the wrath of God and die out.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.040
Changheng.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.440

Who's she?

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:46.600
Why is she in my dress?

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:20.400
A ghost.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.890
Help. Help.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:23.890
Help.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:25.480
Help me.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.480
Let go of me.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.040
Help.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.160
Shut up.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.570
Why do you look the same as me?

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.970
I don't know why

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.520
I have changed bodies with you.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.320
You mean

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:06.170
you are now in my body

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.330
and I in yours...

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:21.890
Then what should we do?

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.600
Do you see the Haotian Matrix?

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.650
That is the exit.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.730
As you are in my body,

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.280
you now have mighty power.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.880
Destroy the matrix with your power

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.800
and we can escape from it.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:04.930
After we go out,

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.000
we can naturally get our bodies back.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.760
The Haotian Matrix?

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.440
Wait.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:16.530
You are a criminal who was sealed.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:18.040
You're cajoling me into letting you out.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.050
You'd better not mention me

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.880
in the same breath with those losers.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.409
My patience is limited.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.810
Destroy the Haotian Matrix now.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:35.679
Or

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.570
I'll kill you.
