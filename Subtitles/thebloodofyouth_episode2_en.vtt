[The Blood of Youth]

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.970
[Episode 2]

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.580
Interesting.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.860
They

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.260
don't even know

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.500
what the Golden Coffin contains.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.700
And they just have to meddle in this.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.620
Yuzhai.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.700
While it's chaotic down there...

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.380
-Hand it out.
-Hand it out now.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.460
I can't tell how strong

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.540
the white-haired man with the jade sword is.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.860
-Hand it over now.
-Quick.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.700
So much noise.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.900
Yuzhai.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.660
Could you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.340
even see when he unsheathed?

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.340
Only the first three slashes.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.900
After that,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.060
it was all a blur.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.580
I thought I already filtered the weaklings.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.420
To my surprise,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.780
many more went unnoticed, it seems.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.260
I'm afraid

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.740
Tang Lian and I

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.740
cannot defeat him at all.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.780
In order to do that...

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.940
Although Three-Gaze City

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.300
saw a surge in visitors lately,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.780
many people

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.380
went missing too.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.740
To spare you the hassle,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.980
I have eliminated

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.380
all the insignificant ones for you, Mr. Tang.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.700
What a fancy pretext you have there.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.180
You merely

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.700
wiped out my rivals.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.580
And then, you want me to fight you.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.420
Yes, that too.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.060
So you're here

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.300
for the coffin, too.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.340
That belongs to Xueyue City.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.180
It seems like

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.300
you don't what it is.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.700
It doesn't belong to Xueyue City.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.180
You know what it is?

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.060
Of course.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.540
Mister, there must be a mistake.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.460
At the moment,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.020
our priority

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.940
is our bet.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.660
If you're not interested,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.220
please move aside.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.900
A bet?

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.900
A bet of life and death.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.540
I am a swordsman.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.340
Only my sword

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.700
decides my fate.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.220
Not a few dice.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.620
However, I'm in the mood

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.500
to play a little game tonight.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.220
If you two win,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.740
you'll have

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.700
one night to flee.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.580
You sound confident.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.340
We'll see

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.580
after the game.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.260
Telekinesis.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.820
I can't believe you're using

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.460
such a lousy trick.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.260
What?

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.660
Come.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.220
Do the people

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.740
from Xueyue City only know how to kill

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.940
and nothing else?

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.340
One round to decide the outcome.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.900
If you win, I leave.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.020
If I win,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.220
leave the coffin here.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.060
That sounds fair.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.620
I once

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.420
gambled with someone for three days straight

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.860
in the Qianjin Gambling House of Tianqi City

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.260
and I won a city.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.100
Do you believe me?

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.660
Only when I see it

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.940
with my eyes.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.940
If you can win a city,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.100
then...

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.060
Five, five, six.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.620
Big.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.020
People in the martial arts world

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.900
are boring.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.180
A bet is only fun

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.740
when you have to gamble your luck.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.820
If you already know

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.220
the outcome,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.940
then the bet

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.380
is meaningless.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.620
What do you want to wager on then?

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.740
I'll wager on

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.780
five, five, six.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.700
Big.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.620
You...

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.940
Okay.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.700
It's been decided then.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.100
Oh, no.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.580
Shattering Touch.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.900
(Its victim might look fine from the outside,)

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.140
(but his innards will be all)

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.900
(destroyed.)

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.580
(must be...)

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.740
Of course, it looks grim.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.180
It's a gamble.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.300
It won't be easy.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Do you want to change your decision then?

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.340
Change my decision?

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.500
The sure-fire way to win a bet

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.380
is to believe that you're winning.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.260
When you believe you're winning,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.700
you will win.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.460
Let's see.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.820
Five, five, six.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.140
Impressive, mister.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.180
You flatter me.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.180
It's just a sleight of hand.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.740
I don't know any martial arts.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.180
You don't?

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.140
The path you're walking is a dangerous one.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.980
If you can't fight,

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.540
you should

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.820
stay out of it.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.420
Are you breaking your promise now?

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.620
I said I wouldn't kill you.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.940
But my friends

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.740
might beg to differ.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:42.900
They

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.380
are more impatient than me.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.700
We also have a friend.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.900
He can be a bit goofy,

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.380
but he packs a mean punch.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.220
So your friends

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.060
might not have the edge.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.420
If you knew who I was,

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.780

your name

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.740

Not many know you.

But some do.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:31.900

They are the Sturdy Phase of Mortal,

the Carefree Phase of Earth,

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.500
the Insouciant Phase of Heaven,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.500
and the Unbeatable Phase of Arcana

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.660

As expected from them.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.140
What is this Tianwaitian?

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.100
You might not

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.220
be familiar with this appellation.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:27.620
But it

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.540
also goes by another name

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:29.860
that will surely jog your memory.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.500
Demon Sect.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:32.540
Demon Sect?

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.380
Can we win?

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.500
If he hadn't shown mercy just now,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:17.980
that slash just now

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.540
would have...

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.460
You're the descendants of my old friends.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.620
Out of respect for your masters,

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.980
I will not kill you.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.420
But if you get in my way again,

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.900
I will not

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.340
be that amicable.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.420
Cloud.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:48.860
Frost.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.140
Thread.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.500
Jade.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.700
The Wushuang Sword Box.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.540
I heard no one has been able

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.940
[Wushuang, Wushuang City]
to command it for a century.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:26.740
Kiddo,

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.420
what is your name?

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.740
Wushuang,
(*unparalleled)

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.180
from the Imperial Wushuang City.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.660
After the emergence of Xueyue City,

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.740
Wushuang City lost

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.060
its imperial

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.340
title.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.620
It will be re-added soon.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.900
Interesting.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.220
What do you want?

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.260
I don't want to miss the opportunity
to fight a powerful foe.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.340
Naturally, I'm here

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.420
to learn from you.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.020
Arrogant, aren't you?

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.900
I don't have time for you.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.180
Charge!

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.460
Stop there!

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.260
Wushuang, come back!

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:09.660
Give chase now.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:14.980
White-Haired Deity

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.290
said his friends were here.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.580
If I were you,

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.300
I would watch over the coffin now.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.140
Do we continue to after them?

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.220
Yes.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:29.900
That

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.020
is Lei Wujie's explosive.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.620
I am Lei Wujie

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.580
of the Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.700
Any brave soul wants to be blasted?

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:42.820
Charge!

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.580
He's fast.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.540
Fire Infusion of the Lei family.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.460
No wonder.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:15.700
Charge.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.140
Tang Lian.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:33.900
You survived

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:34.900
the brawl inside?

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:37.780
How are you feeling?

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:38.980
I just

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:39.740
picked up that technique,

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.060
so I haven't fully mastered it.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:43.660
But I feel much better now.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.260
I can fight around

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:45.980
ten of them.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.740
Fire Infusion.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.340
Where you convert your rage

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.340
into a short burst of strength and agility.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.300
How long

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.780
will your dying ember last?

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.980
Enough to defeat

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.620
people who work in the dark

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:03.700
like you.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.340
Such audacity.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:21.340
What...

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.380
what is going on?

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.740
A phantasmagoria.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.380
Phantasmagoria?

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:30.940
What phantasmagoria?

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:32.700
Look.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:39.780
What?

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.460
Do you notice any discrepancies?

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.860
The moon is big.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.300
But it looks like it is pasted in the sky.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.540
Today is the 22nd.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:54.780
It should be

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.420
a waning crescent.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.300
Not a full moon.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.060
Lian, you mean...

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.460
It's a Guxu Formation.
(*loneliness and emptiness)

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.380
It is

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.580
a sinister array.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.900
Once you're in it,

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.180
you'll enter a dream-like state.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.940
Be careful now.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:16.740
In this dream,

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.380
everything is an illusion,

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.340
but

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:21.540
everything

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.460
is also real.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:25.620
Lian.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.380
What are you talking about?

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.820
I don't get it.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:30.300
Careful.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:46.900
Lian...

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.380
You got him.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.260
How did you do that?

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.500
This is a formation

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.380
filled with murderous traps.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.060
What you see

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.700
might not be real.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:04.980
Therefore,

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.540
you should close your eyes

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.340
and use your ears instead.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.380
Close my eyes?

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.860
Locate by sound.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:17.900
One of the compulsory lessons in Xueyue City.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:19.820
Listen carefully.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.580
Our world is vast

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.900
and wind current is everywhere.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.300
The biggest weakness of this formation

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.420
is that it blocks

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.780
all external noises.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.250
And when you hear

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.660
the sound

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:36.860
of a crack

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.100
in the air,

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:38.940
that's when

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.300
your enemy exposes himself.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:46.900
Listen...

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:58.620
Here.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.500
Bingo.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.460
You're gifted.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.100
I've learned martial arts since young.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.420
And I

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.620
trained my hearing too.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.820
Locate by sound and retaliate.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:26.980
How naive of you

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.300
to assume you can get out of this formation

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.820
with that.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.500
(I was right.)

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.460
(To meet with Fairy Rui,)

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.860
(Lian will pass by Belle's Manor.)

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.660
(It seems like)

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.380
(he was trapped)

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.660
(in some sort of formation.)

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.220
Is this

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.420
the Guxu Formation

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.100
that trapped Father when he fought

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.380
against the Demon Sect?

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.260
Lian.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:09.860
There are a lot of them.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.500
What should we do now?

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:42.900
Remain calm.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.060
Stay composed.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.500
They can't do anything to us.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.500
(I just have to buy time)

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.500
(until Mr. Mo comes back.)

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.180
(There's nothing)

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.140
(you can do.)

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.500
(Father told me)

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.940
(that the Guxu Formation)

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.940
(relies on disruptive flute music.)

00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.420
(Break the flute)

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.740
(and you break the formation.)

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.180
Lian, what was that?

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:09.700
A spear.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.020
Qianluo is here.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.540
Stop speaking.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.340
I'll follow the sound.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:25.620
The formation is broken.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:33.780
Boss.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:36.620
What do you think, Lian?

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:37.740
Isn't our teamwork

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.140
impeccable?

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.980
You must be Miss Sikong.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.300
I'm Lei Wujie.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:43.340
Don't let your guard down.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.420
It's not over yet.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.300
You...

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:48.900
I have

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.700
dispelled the phantasmagoria.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.100
What else do you have?

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.580
Show me now.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.340
Indeed.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.700
You broke the formation.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.500
So you followed us here.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.020
Truth be told,

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.460
we do not want

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.660
to cross Xueyue City.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.020
But it seems like

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.660
Wushuang City and Tianwaitian

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.780
are involved too.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.740
If we don't intervene,

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.140
it'll be too late.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.260
What's inside the coffin

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.580
is important to us

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.540
and we cannot give it up.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.540
What

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.740
is inside?

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.460
For some,

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.500
it's a fortune.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.660
For some,

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.540
it's a powerful technique.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.420
For us,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.220
it's an answer.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:39.740
Answer?

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.740
Thirteen years ago...

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:42.700
Enough.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.340
The Wangyi Parlor Murder 13 years ago.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.460
Within a night, the entire parlor

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.540
was wiped out.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.180
The eldest son of the owner, Xie Liuyi,

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.340
was knocked out,

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.220
but he survived.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.060
After he regained consciousness,

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.300
he lost his memory

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.660
regarding that night.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.500
He then studied under Sage Tianquan

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.740
and became an assassin.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.780
He has a new name, Minghou.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.740
You know a lot.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.460
Unfortunately,

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:15.900
Wangyi Parlor Murder

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.500
will remain a mystery.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.700
Even if there were clues to be had,

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.420
they would have disappeared

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.580
after 13 years.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.420
Do you truly believe

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.420
the coffin

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.940
contains your answer?

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.740
I have to admit

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.460
that I'm getting

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.460
more and more interested in this coffin.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:39.700
Stop!

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.740
This is getting interesting.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.260
Living dead!

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.940
[Wuxin]

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.260
A monk?

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.300
A living monk?

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:28.660
No ordination scar.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.460
He isn't a monk.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.340
Bring him with us first.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:05.820
Minghou.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.980
I have met you.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.780
I have talked to Abbot Wangyou,

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:29.500
but

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.580
he wouldn't help me.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.260
Old Wangyou said

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.020
no matter what

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.300
the answer was,

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.260
it would haunt you.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.940
I appreciate

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.860
Abbot Wangyou's kindness.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:45.660
However,

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.220
knowing the answer will haunt me.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.180
Not knowing it

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.340
will also haunt me.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:55.980
Makes sense.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:17.580
Minghou.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.020
Are you all right?

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.340
What Old Wangyou wouldn't tell you,

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.580
I have told you.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.700
This is your tribulation.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.220
All the best.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.500
To return the favor,

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.300
we can get you

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:45.940
out of here.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.660
This is my tribulation.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:57.700
Just leave.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.020
Let's go.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:09.940
Wushuang.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:10.780
Wushuang.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:11.500
Wushuang.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:12.740
Wushuang.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.820
-Wushuang.
-Wushuang.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:16.500
Wushuang.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.580
Wushuang.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:18.540
Wushuang.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.340
Wushuang.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:19.980
Wushuang.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.020
Wushuang.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:23.620
Yuzhai.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.460
-Wushuang.
-Come here.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.100
Wushuang.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:26.900
Wushuang Sword Box.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:31.180
What...

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:35.900
How can this be?

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.540
Is he...

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.540
Is he...

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:43.740
Yuzhai.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:44.580
Yuzhai.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.260
How can this be?

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.020
How can this happen?

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.580
How am I supposed to face the City Lord now?

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:54.980
It's all my fault.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.220
Yuzhai.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.460
I got ahead of myself

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.860
and that's why he's dead.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.140
Oh, my little martial brother.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.020
Wushuang...

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.060
Why are you here?

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.700
He was fast

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.620
and I got tired of chasing, so I fell asleep.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.300
I'm going to hit you!

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:18.980
Yuzhai.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:19.740
I'll hit you!

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:20.860
-Yuzhai.
-Yuzhai.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:21.940
Don't do this.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:22.380
Let go of me.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:22.900
Let go!

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.420
Calm down, Yuzhai.

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:23.860
Come here.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:24.660
Calm down.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:24.980
Come here now!

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.300
Stop.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:26.300
Calm down.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.420
Don't do anything reckless.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.260
Yes.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.260
Fine.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:31.900
He is powerful.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.340
He could have killed you easily.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.380
I'm glad you're fine.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:35.940
What should we do now then?

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.940
Even if we return to Belle's Manor now,

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.580
we won't get what we're after.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:42.980
Let's retreat

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.180
and plan again.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:45.380
Go.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:14.500
Close your eyes.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.500
Don't look at him.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.340
Your liaison is here.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:23.780
I'm Wuchan.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.980
This is my younger martial brother.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.780
[Wuchan, Jiulong Sect]

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.540
He is also a disciple

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.500
of Abbot Wangyou.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:29.740
He's Wuxin.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.740
This is not a great place for conversations.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.300
Let's leave first.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.100
Lian.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.260
Isn't

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.580
osmanthus cake your favorite?

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:53.860
What is the matter?

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.060
Let me feed you.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:57.620
They are watching.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:58.540
Stop it.

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.540
Boring.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:02.980
By the way,

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:04.900
why did you tag along?

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.780
I like that mister over there.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:09.580
Is there a problem?

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.260
Oh, Tang Lian.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.780
I received a missive

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.580
stating that per Jiulong Sect's request,

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.940
Xueyue City assigned you to escort Wuxin

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:19.780
and to meet with me.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.740
It failed to mention your entourage here.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.660
May I know...

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:24.740
She is the daughter

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.820
of the Spear Deity Sikong Changfeng,

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:26.780
Sikong Qianluo.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:27.940
I

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.220
am Lei Wujie

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.740
of the Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.820
I'm just a no-name innkeeper.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:35.820
The lad of the Lei Clan

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:36.980
and I

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.260
have a business to settle in Xueyue City.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.500
She

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.820
is Fairy Rui from Belle's Manor.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:42.820
They

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.540
are with me.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:46.340
Why was

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.260
your martial brother

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.340
in the Golden Coffin?

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.420
It

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.740
is the treasure of Hanshui Temple,

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.820
capable of suppressing one's

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:53.540
inner force.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.060
Suppress?

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.740
He studies the 32 Secret

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.700
Rakshasa Arts.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.140
Master Dajue thinks

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.020
he is dangerous,

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.700
so he is to travel

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.980
within the Golden Coffin.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.340
I heard once you master any one

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.620
of the secret arts,

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:08.980
you can obtain godlike power.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.660
And your martial brother here

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.340
learned all of them?

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:15.980
Abbot Wangyou

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.780
was a revered monk.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.620
Why would he allow Wuxin

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:21.820
to study those secret arts?

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.180
The story

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.500
began with Abbot Wangyou.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.420
Abbot Wangyou had mastered
the Six Wisdom of Buddhism.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.740
Among which his Divine Eye was the most powerful.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:35.980
(They say visitors)

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.900
(who go to Hanshui Temple)

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.860
(just have to look at Wangyou)

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:40.780
(and they will automatically)

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.620
repent for their sins.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.580
Really?

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:46.900
They don't need to talk?

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.140
His mastery of Divine Eye was so proficient

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.780
(that he could read someone's mind)

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.580
(and change it.)

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.380
(That's how he enlightened people.)

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.700
However, several months ago,

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.020
Abbot Wangyou passed away suddenly.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.180
Rumor has it

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.620
that after Abbot Wangyou passed away,

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.540
(his body turned to dust)

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.820
(and disappeared into thin air.)

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.740
The rumor is right.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.340
Why did he die suddenly?

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.050
Another rumor says

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.980
that Abbot Wangyou

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.740
died from a heavy burden.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.060
You know many things, mister.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.140
Indeed.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.380
Someone has been forcing Master

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.140
to surrender Wuxin

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.580
because he

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:30.980
once performed

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.060
my master's mind-reading trick too.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.700
But his is called Abyssal Eye.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.020
Abyssal Eye?

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.540
What is that?

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.180
I have never heard of it.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:41.740
Divine Eye

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:43.900
sees your soul

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.460
and reads your mind.

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:48.260
But Abyssal Eye

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.820
doesn't see your soul.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.660
It sees your inner demon.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.700
If I'm not mistaken,

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:54.940
Wuxin here

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.740
cannot study Buddhism somehow,

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.540
so Abbot Wangyou let him

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.620
study the Rakshasa secret arts.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.820
And now, he has

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.060
those 32 secret arts

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.740
and he is powerful.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.420
No wonder

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:10.780
so many people want him.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.940
Master Dajue planned
to use the Purification Chants

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.140
to erase those secret arts from Wuxin.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.700
But that will cripple him.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.460
Yet after

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:21.460
Wuxin

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.060
learned that,

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.420
he suspended his breath

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.580
and lay in the coffin.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.660
He did not fight back.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.220
So the Demon Sect is interested in Wuxin

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.700
because

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.410
of those secret arts?

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.380
Demon Sect?

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:34.380
Enough.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.140
Knowing too much about the Demon Sect

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.980
brings ill fortune.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.820
He is right.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:44.980
Who's there?

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:48.580
You again.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:49.740
All right.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.460
Hand him over to me now

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.140
and you will yet breathe.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:55.300
In your dream.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.260
Lian.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:58.260
Let me help you.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.420
Protect Wuxin.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:09.420
Aren't you going to help?

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.140
I can't fight.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:12.860
Protect Wuxin.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.100
White-Haired Deity here

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:17.580
is in the Insouciant Phase of Heaven.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.180
All of you can hardly

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.660
touch him.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:35.860
Wait for me!

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.260
Wait for me!

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:47.660
I'm not up there yet.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:26.940
It's futile.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.700
He is a cut above.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:29.660
A numerical advantage

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:30.300
will not change anything.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.300
What should we do then?

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:34.980
Use this.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.740
You know what that is?

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.700
Judging from its shape,

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:40.860
it must be the Lei Clan's

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.660
Qilin Fangs.

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.220
They say it's so strong

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.020
that it can scare a god away.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:46.900
The recipe

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:47.740
for that has been lost.

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:48.700
We only have one left

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.620
and my clan leader is keeping it.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.820
I can't possibly have it.

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.100
Wait.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.780
My clan leader told me not to tell that to anyone.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:55.860
Poor Lei Clan.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.860
But you're right.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:58.980
This is our only option.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:02.780
I don't want

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.500
to fight youngsters like you.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:06.420
As I said,

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:07.980
hand him over to me.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.100
My patience

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.660
has a limit.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:11.380
Move aside.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.260
Watch me.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.540
So it has come to this.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:24.260
A sword?

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.740
The Lei Clan prohibits

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.940
its disciples from using a sword.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:28.980
Is that the sword, Shabu?
(*terrifying)

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.380
Shabu, the long sword.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.780
You're a disciple of Lei Hong.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:01.660
I see.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.540
All of you truly think

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.220
I won't kill you.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:27.860
What an imposing sword aura.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.540
He is mad now.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.260
Too much.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.820
You look too much like him.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.580
Crimson Leaves.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.540
I didn't expect this move from you

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.410
despite your injury.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.900
You must be within the top three

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.260
of the Tang Clan.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.940
Have you heard of this saying?

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.100
What saying?

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.180
Three moves of the Tang

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.100
leave one dead.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.220
It seems like

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.580
I underestimated you.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.740
Who else

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:01.900
wants to try me?

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.140
Me!

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:08.820
If you don't want to live a handicapped life,

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.020
don't get up.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.180
(Can you still stand up?)

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:15.580
(Stop gawking.)

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.100
(Only you can hear me.)

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.260
(If you)

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.340
(still have any strength left,)

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.660
(stand before me.)

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.180
(Stop looking around.)

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.460
(That white-haired man)

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:28.820
(will soon take me away.)

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.220
(Hurry up)

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:31.980
(and present yourself before me.)

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:38.460
Tang Lian.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.340
I don't want to kill you.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.540
So don't force me.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.020
(How many hidden weapons do you have?)

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:45.660
(Bone Nail.)

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:46.740
(Iron Spike.)

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:47.900
(Dragon Needle.)

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.420
(You only have one chance.)

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.060
(Unleash all of them.)

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.060
(Use Fatal Blossom Shower.)

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.060
(Not everyone from the Tang Clan)

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.140
(can use it.)

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.300
(But you're Tang Lian.)

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.260
(You can do it.)

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:02.220
If you insist,

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.620
prepare for my attack.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:05.860
(Now!)

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.860
(You didn't let me down.)

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.220
(But that)

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.740
(won't delay him for too long.)
