00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.080
Today,

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.390
I'm gonna massacre all immortal sects

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.320
so that no immortals will exist

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.670
throughout Four Continents
and Three Realms.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:22.870
My Lady,

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.670
I thought you had some power.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.000
But you turn out to be so weak.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:34.870
[Mirror of the Past…]

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.720
[Father,]

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.270
[I… I can't go back home.]

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.480
What's that between your eyebrows?

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.550
[Mirror of the Past…]

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720
[Where am I?]

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.670
[Surprisingly, my blood activated
the Mirror of the Past.]

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.630
[Li Susu.]

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:40.670
[Who are you?]

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.840
[How do you know my name?]

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.390
[It doesn't matter who I am.]

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.120
[But who you are]

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.000
[means really a lot to this world.]

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:51.870
[Me?]

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:53.910
[Yes.]

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.200
[Devil God wants the Mirror of the Past]

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.720
[because the Chosen One can use it]

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.640
[to reverse the destiny.]

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.350
[And you are]

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.110
[the Chosen One.]

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.440
[Reverse the destiny?]

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.510
[Yes.]

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.920
[The Devil God wasn't born to be evil.]

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.640
[His past is his only weakness.]

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:19.880
[What should I do?]

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.510
[Watch carefully]

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.960
[and remember him.]

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:30.920
Bark like a dog.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:36.960
Say something.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.550
Oh, Tantai Jin.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.590
Has the cat got your tongue?

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.550
We're talking to you.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.000
Say something!

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.070
What a coward!

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.790
Indeed.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.640
He doesn't even fight back.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:48.240
[He's the Devil God.]

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.310
Even dogs are fiercer than you.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.030
All you can do is be punched.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:52.830
Yeah.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.720
[It's the Devil God's prelife.]
Punch him! Punch him!

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.140
Beat him!

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.030
[500 years ago, he was a mortal,]
Beat him! Beat him!

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.720
[born in the Palace of the Sheng.]

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.200
[But as the evil fetus,]

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.350
[he was already accumulating strength
for the Devil God's revival.]

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:25.960
[Li Susu,]

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:27.960
[time is running out.]

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.030
[The Devil God has already appeared.]

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.920
[But if he failed
to become a devil back then,]

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.440
[today's destruction wouldn't happen.]

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.310
[Remember the person you have to find.]

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.510
[Go back to Hengyang Sect
and activate the Light-breaking Array.]

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.000
[It's the only way to turn the tide.]

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.400
[Now, the Devil God is unbeatable.]

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.240
[I have to go back to the time
before he turned evil.]

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.110
[It's our only opportunity.]

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.750
I won't let you hurt her.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.310
Don't kill him!

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.400
Gongye!

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.480
Susu, don't worry about me.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.160
Take the Mirror
and go back to Hengyang Sect.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.830
No, I'm not leaving!

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.350
I won't let you catch her.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.400
Devil God,

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.030
are you scared of death?

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.400
No!

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.440
Susu.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:08.960
Susu.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.880
Why are you back alone?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.720
Where's Jiwu?

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.440
Father,

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.590
check this.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:23.920
Even dogs are fiercer than you.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.720
All you can do is be punched.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.440
Yeah.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.270
-Punch him!
-Punch him!

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.960
Beat him!

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.070
-Punch him!
-Beat him!

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.000
Beat him! Beat him!

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.480
The Mirror is broken.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:41.790
That is all we can watch.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.550
At least, we know that

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.350
the Devil God wasn't born to be evil.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.590
When he was a teenager,

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.720
he was merely a weak mortal.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.030
If we return to the past with the Array

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.000
and kill Tantai Jin before he turns evil,

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.750
the Devil God won't come into being.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.880
Father,

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.350
let me do it.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.400
You?

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.480
OK.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.680
It's Susu

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.920
who took back the Mirror
and showed us the past.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.440
It's her destiny.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.750
Susu, remember.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:24.750
Born as an evil fetus,

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.270
Tantai Jin has evil bones.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.110
If his body dies,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.510
his evil bones will wake up.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:30.920
Then immediately, he'll become a devil.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.790
So, you must find a way

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.720
to destroy his evil bones first

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.790
to kill him completely.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.830
[I'm here to get the Mirror of the Past.]

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.640
[Members of Hengyang Sect,]

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.680
[come out and welcome me.]

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.440
[Hengyang Sect]

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.790
The Devil God has come. Form up!

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.270
Zhaoyou, activate the Light-breaking Array

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.720
and send Susu back to the past!

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.160
[Ten thousand years ago,
God of Cosmos left the Light-breaking Array,]

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.510
[which was inherited by leaders
of my sect through generations.]

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.640
[Unification of Heaven and Earth]
[It can't be activated unless it has to.]

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.830
Qu, the time is now.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.000
What are you waiting for?

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:28.590
Wait.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.070
Uncle Zhaoyou, what are you talking about?

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:31.240
Father!

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.070
Gods left a prophecy when they died.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.510
On the destruction day of immortal sects,

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.440
someone would get
into the Light-breaking Array

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.030
and change the past and future.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:45.400
The destruction day?

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.200
Uncle Zhaoyou, stop!

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.590
Father!

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.270
Father!

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.000
[Susu,]

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.830
[when we have a chance]

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.160
[to stop the Devil God from appearing,]

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.030
[there may be some hope for the world.]

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.400
[It's your destiny to get
into the Light-breaking Array and live.]

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.440
[Defending our sects until we die]

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.160
[is the destiny of Zhaoyou and me.]

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.310
[Farewell, Susu.]

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.550
[Take care of yourself in another world.]

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.680
All my disciples, under my command!

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.350
-Aye!
-Aye!

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.240
This is a life-and-death fight
for our world.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:20.880
Now, we shall defend Mingwu Hall
until we die!

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.240
The barrier won't be broken
until the last one of us dies!

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.200
Form up!

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.480
You're really stubborn.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.110
Father!

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.830
Susu, we have no time.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.680
You must return to the past right away.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.270
That will be the only chance.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.350
I'll send you back to the Sheng Kingdom
of 500 years ago.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.270
Remember.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.070
Whatever you see, don't come back!

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.590
Four Continents and Three Realms
counts on you!

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:15.310
Understand?

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.350
My turn.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.240
God-slaughtering Crossbow.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.350
No.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.480
No.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.750
No!

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.400
Father!

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.070
Tantai Jin,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.790
I swear I'll kill you.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.510
Why is the sky blue?

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.110
Miss.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.960
Why are you talking so weirdly?

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.680
Miss.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:06.350
Did you hit your head,

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:07.160
Miss?

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.350
Miss, wake up.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.790
[Remember the person you have to find.]

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.000
[Try to stop the Devil God from appearing]

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.960
[and there will be a new ending.]

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.920
Miss.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.880
[Father, Uncle Zhaoyou,]

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.550
[I did return to the past.]

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.790
[Wait for me.]

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.310
[Susu,]

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.440
[I trust you.]

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.550
[You'll make it.]

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.350
Wait for me.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.880
Miss.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.750
Miss, wake up!

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.510
Please.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.590
Umm…

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:41.440
Excuse me.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.440
Could you get me up?

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.960
I feel a little bit dizzy.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.440
[First, I have to figure out
what happened.]

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.960
Well, what's your name?

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.720
Miss,

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.720
I'm Chuntao!

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.160
-Chuntao?
-You really hit your head.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.750
If His Lordship knows, he'll kill me.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.440
[Sounds like I'm from a rich family.]

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.070
Chuntao, you're right.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.440
I had a heavy fall,

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.030
and I can't remember anything now.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.880
Could you do me a favor?

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.750
Miss,

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.640
if you want me to do anything,

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.110
just ask me to.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.920
You sounded a little bit scary.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.480
You even smiled at me.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:40.440
Chuntao.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.790
Tell me.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.480
What's my name, and who are my parents?

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.310
Your full name is Ye Xiwu.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.240
You're the second lineal daughter
of General Ye.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.510
Oh, I remember this.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.830
But what were we doing here
in the wilderness?

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.480
Oh, I can't remember. My head hurts.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.640
Miss Xiwu,

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.030
we went to Cishou Temple
to offer incense earlier today.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.440
After that,

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.240
you insisted on going sightseeing.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.720
We ran into some bandits on our way

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.920
who threatened to rob you
of your money and violate you.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.720
Did they succeed?

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:20.350
No.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.110
We scrambled all the way here.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.440
But you rolled down from that slope

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.750
and passed out.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.000
So, we were running away from bandits?

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.790
Did we get rid of them?

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.160
Look. There she is!

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:36.350
Go.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.640
[Oh, no.]

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.310
[A mortal can't fly.]

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.160
What are you doing?

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:48.720
Nothing. My feet were numb.
I had to stamp them.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.590
Run!

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:52.000
Girls, stop running!

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.200
You can't get away.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.110
Miss Xiwu, stop running!

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.790
You can't get away, anyway!

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:03.310
Go hide somewhere.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.880
All right.

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.480
Forget it. Why not hide behind me?

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:11.310
All right.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.030
Miss Xiwu,

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.590
thank you for protecting me.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.920
If only you always had a problem
with your head!

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.030
I would try my best.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:20.590
-Miss Xiwu, stop running!
-Miss Xiwu!

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:21.590
Stop there!

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.270
Tell me

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.110
who sent you to hurt me,

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:40.720
and I will let you go.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.720
Miss Xiwu,

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.790
why did you ask like that?

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.510
Just now, he called me Miss Xiwu.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:47.480
Apparently, they knew

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.000
I was General Ye's lineal daughter.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.400
If real bandits wanted to rob me,

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.960
they would have to hesitate.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.310
Miss Xiwu,

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.550
you've been so clever
since you hit your head.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.920
So, you would still fight, huh?

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.200
Dudes, catch her!

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.000
Go!

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.000
[Ye Xiwu, do you learn
no martial arts at all?]

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.400
[Do you never exercise?]

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:23.720
[Come on, Li Susu.]

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.270
[Four Continents and Three Realms
are waiting for you.]

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.350
[Do I have to die
even before my mission starts?]

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.880
[Chongyu Harp is closely related to me.]

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.030
[I will summon it.]

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.440
[I have to summon it!]

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.110
Chongyu Harp!

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.440
Chong… Chong what?

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:38.790
Miss Xiwu,

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.440
you dropped your pendant.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:41.440
[Darn it.]

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.400
[Now, I only have a mortal's body]

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.310
[without any martial arts.]

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:45.880
[I can't even summon my weapon.]

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.070
[I have to fight on my own.]

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.240
Miss Xiwu!

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:57.480
Miss Xiwu!

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:59.160
Run. Come on.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:25.400
Jiwu?

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.000
Jiwu!

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.960
Miss Xiwu, behave yourself.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.030
Jiwu.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.710
Gongye Jiwu.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.230
What did you call me?

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.230
Your Highness.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.670
Your Highness, are you all right?

00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:59.510
Miss Ye?

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:01.190
Not you again.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.360
[He isn't Jiwu.]

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.190
Prince Lin,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.190
Miss Xiwu hit her head just now,

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.030
and she's a little bit confused now.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.360
Please forgive her.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:15.150
Miss Xiwu,

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:16.710
stop pretending.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.230
In my life,
I love no one but Ye Bingchang.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:22.000
I won't have feelings for you.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.710
I just saved you for reasons of morals.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.150
Hope you'll behave yourself.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:28.190
Farewell.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.360
[It's not the world after 500 years.]

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:39.710
He's Prince Lin?

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:41.550
Yes, his name is Xiao Lin.

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:44.230
It's all right that
you don't remember your parents.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.630
But why do you not remember Prince Lin?

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.400
Then tell me about him.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:52.550
Who is he?

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.190
Prince Lin is the only lineal son
of His Majesty.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.840
He's the most popular with our people,

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:00.150
known as Prince Camellia.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.550
What did he mean when he said
he loved someone

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.710
and didn't have feelings for me?

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.110
Now that you have forgotten it,
please don't ask.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.150
Forget it forever.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.000
It doesn't matter. Just tell me.

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.550
Previously,

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.550
you adored Prince Lin
but couldn't be with him.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.550
And soon,

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.070
he'll marry your elder sister.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.000
I adored him?

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.230
Everyone in the capital city
knows about that.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.400
He just mentioned Ye Bingchang.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:35.510
So, she's my elder sister?

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.550
The other day,
Prince Lin came to our mansion

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.510
to visit Miss Bingchang.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.710
You felt so upset

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.230
that you pushed her into the lake.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.030
Prince Lin is still angry about it.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.670
Don't blame him for being rude.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.230
[Pushed her into the lake?]

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.960
[Ye Xiwu, weren't you too wicked?]

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:58.550
Is my sister all right?

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.150
I heard she had a cold,

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.230
and it wasn't very serious.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.190
But Miss Xiwu,
you were really weird today.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:10.030
You craved to come here
and pray for Miss Bingchang.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.000
Miss Xiwu!

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.710
Stop.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.590
Miss Xiwu, how was it?

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:18.110
How was what?

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.150
Stay away!

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.550
How was our performance?

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.480
We didn't frighten you, did we?

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.230
You asked us

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.710
to be as fierce as we could.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:31.840
Miss Xiwu, don't deny it.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.400
You promised us.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.030
If we got Prince Lin here to save you,

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.230
you would give us
another ten taels of silver.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:41.670
You saw him, talked to him,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.150
and cuddled into his arms.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:45.710
Isn't it time to pay us?

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.840
Miss Xiwu,

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.190
I won't tell anyone about it.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.920
[Gorgeous, Ye Xiwu.]

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.230
[I can't even imagine how wicked you're.]

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.880
Miss Xiwu, keep it in mind.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.630
Your father is
Pillar of the State Great General.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:07.230
Your dead mother
was Commandery Princess Rong'en.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.030
Your grandmother is Grand Princess Royal.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.000
All your family members are

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.190
high-ranking nobles of the Sheng Kingdom.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.510
Got it. I can nearly recite it.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:16.840
When I get back home,

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.710
you must help me.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.030
[Ye Mansion]
Don't let my father know I hit my head.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.920
Don't worry, Miss Xiwu.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.230
Count on me.

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:25.070
[What an impressive mansion!]

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.800
[Family background is really important.]

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.110
[I wonder where the Devil God is.]

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:33.920
Chuntao,

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.710
there's someone I want to ask you about.

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:40.230
Maybe you haven't heard of him.

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.110
He lives in the Palace, I guess.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.440
Try me.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.320
His name is Tantai Jin.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.440
Have you heard of him?

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.550
Do you know him?

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.960
He's Mr. Tantai,

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.280
your husband.

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:07.030
Miss Xiwu.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:08.710
This is the garden.

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:11.190
Mr. Tantai is still there, I suppose.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:12.320
Almost there.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.960
[I didn't expect
to find the Devil God so soon.]

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:17.510
[I wonder how powerful he is
since he's from 500 years ago.]

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.230
[I only have a mortal's body]

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.710
[and can't use Chongyu Harp.]

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.480
[Can I kill him?]

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.400
Miss Xiwu,

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:26.230
why do you look so terrible?

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:28.920
Chuntao,

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.230
you mentioned Tantai Jin
had lived with my family for six months.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.510
Do you know his Achilles' Heel?

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:35.230
Achilles' Heel?

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.280
It means something he's scared of.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.880
Miss Xiwu,

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.360
how could you forget this?

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:47.920
In this family, you're the one

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:49.760
he's most scared of.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.920
[The Devil God wasn't born to be evil.]

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.150
[When he was a teenager,]

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.360
[he was merely a weak mortal.]

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.400
[Looks like the God
in the Mirror of the Past]

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.590
[was right.]

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:07.760
[Now, Tantai Jin is]

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:10.280
[a mere mortal.]

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.110
[At this moment,
I might as well meet the Devil God]

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.070
[who hasn't grown stronger yet?]

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.590
[The Light-breaking Array sent me
to the right place at the right time.]

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:28.280
[I found him so easily.]

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.670
[It seems even Heaven helped me.]

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.360
[So this person is Tantai Jin,]

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:52.800
[the evil fetus?]

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.670
[He looks so weak.]

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:01.070
[Will he really become the Devil God?]

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.230
[If his name weren't Tantai Jin,]

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.070
[I couldn't believe]

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.550
[that he would be the Devil God.]

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.030
You…

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.400
I…

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.920
Miss Xiwu, what do you want to say?

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:52.440
[If I killed him,]

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:55.630
[I could stop the Devil God's advent]

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.070
[and Four Continents and Three Realms
would not be destroyed.]

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.480
[But before I came here,
Father said something.]

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.030
[Susu,]

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.590
[born with the evil origin,]

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:05.550
[Tantai Jin has an evil bone.]

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.400
[If his body dies,
his evil bone will wake up.]

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.960
[Then immediately, he'll become a devil.]

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.590
[So, you must find a way
to destroy his evil bone first]

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.070
[to kill him completely.]

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.030
[Be patient, Li Susu.]

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.360
[Before his evil bone is destroyed,
he must be alive.]

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.110
[But where is his evil bone?]

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.400
[And how can I destroy it?]

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:44.510
[The more I look at him,
the stranger I find it]

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:46.800
[Could something go wrong?]

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:50.000
[Everything went so smoothly.]

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:56.510
[Even dogs in Hengyang Sect
are fiercer than him.]

00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.960
[Does he just look like the Devil God,]

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.030
[just as Xiao Lin looks like Jiwu?]

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.550
[No. I can't kill an innocent man.]

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
[I have to confirm this.]

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.320
Miss Xiwu, it's so cold.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.510
Let's go inside.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.630
Tantai Jin,

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:19.110
show me your hand.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.400
Mr. Tantai.

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:26.480
A bit closer.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.030
Tantai Jin,

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:34.960
try strangling me.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.150
Don't shrink.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.670
Give me a fierce look.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:40.590
Have a try.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:46.840
Miss Xiwu,

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:49.030
punish me as you wish.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:51.440
Don't bother to tease me.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:10.320
Tantai Jin,

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:12.440
think of it in your heart

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:14.840
that you want to kill someone

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.440
and that you want to kill me.

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.800
I'm gonna massacre all immortal sects

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.150
so that no immortals will exist.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.510
[It's him!]

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:44.150
Miss Xiwu.

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:45.590
Miss… Miss Xiwu.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.710
Miss Xiwu, what's the matter?

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.360
Did Mr. Tantai strangle you too hard?

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:14.440
You've been shuddering.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.000
Shall I walk you back to your room?

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.840
All right.

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.800
Chuntao,

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.230
let's stay away from Tantai Jin.

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:33.110
Why is Tantai Jin kneeling on the ice?

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.800
Don't you remember?

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.400
You punished him
by letting him kneel for three days.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.190
And he just did that?

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.550
What'd you expect?

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.000
[Ye Xiwu, good for you.]

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.920
[You're even bossier than the Devil God.]

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.840
What did I punish him for?

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.510
Oh, I can't remember that.

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:55.510
It was because of the event

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.880
where you pushed Miss Bingchang
into the lake.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.590
How was Tantai Jin involved?

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.190
You slipped

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.550
and fell into the lake, too.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.800
Prince Lin jumped
into the water immediately

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.320
and swam to save Miss Bingchang.

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:09.070
Seeing that,

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.360
Mr. Tantai jumped into the water, too.

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:11.760
To save me?

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:14.480
To save… Miss Bingchang.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.320
They got Miss Bingchang out of the water.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.280
But you struggled your own way out of it.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.550
You were furious about that.

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:21.920
Then you punish Mr. Tantai
by letting him kneel out there.

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:24.440
That night, it snowed heavily.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:26.190
The lake was covered with a sheet of ice.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.360
You were happy to see that

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.190
and asked Mr. Tantai to kneel on the ice.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:30.280
You said,

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:32.480
"Tantai Jin,

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.760
don't you love to show off in the lake?

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.070
Then kneel there for a couple of days!"

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:40.760
This is ridiculous.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.920
I mean,

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:46.760
Tantai Jin didn't take my side
and helped someone else.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.480
This is ridiculous.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:51.670
Miss Xiwu, don't be angry,

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:52.960
or it will be bad for your health.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:55.550
Although Mr. Tantai likes Miss Bingchang…

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:56.110
What?

00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:59.880
Are you saying

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.000
Tantai Jin likes Ye Bingchang?

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:03.800
But he can only think about her!

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.510
Miss Xiwu, you do cruel punishments.

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.280
Mr. Tantai never has the guts.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.480
He has to stay with you but think of her.

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.880
So, I like Prince Lin,

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.000
while he likes my elder sister.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:18.320
And Tantai Jin likes her, too.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:18.920
Exactly.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.190
[Ye Xiwu,]

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.510
[you and your husband are impressive.]

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:29.800
[Since you both like someone else,]

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.360
[how do you live together?]

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.760
Now that I adored Prince Lin,

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.510
why did I marry Tantai Jin?

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:38.440
I don't know.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.710
But back at that time,

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:43.000
Mr. Tantai was called Prince Tantai.

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:44.230
How could I

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.030
humiliate a prince this way?

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:48.960
Princes have different destinies.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.960
I heard

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.920
when Mr. Tantai
was a prince in Jing Kingdom,

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.590
and nobody liked him.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.000
When he was very little,

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:57.550
he was sent to our kingdom as a hostage.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.000
So, Tantai Jin is a hostage from the Jing.

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.320
Then why does nobody like him?

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.630
Mr. Tantai is quite cranky.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.150
So, he's always disliked.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.480
Some dislike him unexpectedly.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:13.030
His father, for example.

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:15.880
It seems he never

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.110
cares about Mr. Tantai's life.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.110
Relying on well-provisioned
and well-trained troops,

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:22.440
Jing Kingdom rose in arms in autumn,
saying they'd fight across the Mohe River

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.510
and spend the Spring Festival
in our capital.

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:25.190
Thanks to Mr. Ye, our master.

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:27.000
He not only repulsed

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.440
Jing Kingdom's troops

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:30.840
but also drove them back to their kingdom!

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:32.110
Quite impressive!

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:35.110
As far as I see,

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.840
Mr. Tantai happened

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.070
to marry you at that time,

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:40.710
so he survived.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:41.710
Otherwise,

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.960
His Majesty would have killed him first.
