WEBVTT

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.700
Sit tight.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.550
I almost wet my pants!

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.110
Goodness!

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.200
The entrance is so narrow.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.600
I thought we were going to hit the wall.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.160
I was scared to death.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.640
The Eagle is amazing!

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.060
You said

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.780
when we entered the Mound,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.800
your Mark throbbed painfully.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.620
That's right.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.900
Right here.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.139
It's a little embarrassing.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.810
I can't show you.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.390
I guess

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.780
your Lord has sensed that you're in danger.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.730
He's probably worried about you.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.400
But I've sensed nothing from him.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.300
If you want to sense him,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.890
I can teach you.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.290
I'm listening.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.980
You can

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.450
use your Mark to generate the Power,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.300
and have it pass through your route of power flow.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.210
Lords and…

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.410
Lords and disciples share the same route.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.100
You just need more practice.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.220
Watch and learn.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.510
What's wrong?

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.210
I sensed a disturbing power.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.579
Feng Hun may be in danger.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.850
I must find the Halidom soon,

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.890
so that we can leave.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.180
I'm here.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.800
What are you waiting for?

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.100
Fine.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.900
Release your Beasts.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.450
Let's have a fight!

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.310
Since it's inevitable,

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.300
I'll grant your wish.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.630
That's more like it.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.120
I'm excited.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.000
You tricked me!

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.610
Ever since Lotus and I

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.390
have become the Disciple and Lord,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.300
we've been focusing on training

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.480
and protecting the Beasts.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.680
The Red Order is unreasonable.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.350
I know

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.950
you don't care,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.990
and you won't question it.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.010
Although our fight is inevitable,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.010
I won't drag the Beasts into this.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.410
They've been dispelled.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.020
I can't care less

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.220
about the content

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.420
in the Red Order.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.720
I meant to battle with you.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.500
What a shame

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.720
that you wouldn't cooperate.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.410
Then I'll enjoy

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.930
the fun myself.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.930
I'm disappointed.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.920
What about the other knee?

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.130
If you're down on both knees,

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.380
I might help save your disciple.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.500
Ice Fang seems to like you.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.380
Really?

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.910
That's probably because of my scent.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.290
I'm a natural Beast trainer.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.920
Whenever Feng Hun is free,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.900
we'll go to the Abyssal Valley to practice.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.220
That place has the most Beasts.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.159
Gradually,

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:33.360
I've become friends with them.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.400
Your lord treats you so well.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.640
How I wish

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.200
my lord could be as good as yours!

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.820
Every time I make mistakes,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.600
I have to spit ice chippings out.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:50.670
Ice chippings?

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.330
But…

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.280
I've been speaking ill of him

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.210
ever since we entered here,

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.450
yet he hasn't punished me.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.560
That's strange.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.800
I've never heard of

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.080
such a strange punishment.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.810
You haven't?

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.760
I assumed water-origin Lords

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.220
would all punish their disciples like this.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.420
Of course not.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.590
Some Lords don't even know each other.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.970
A few of them haven't even met my lord.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.650
So all the powerful Halidoms are here, right?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.010
What a grand gate!

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.100
This is just a tip of the iceberg.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.050
We haven't reached the center.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.110
Not yet?

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.610
Are you ready?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.300
No need to ask me.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.200
I got here on accident, anyway.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.890
Are you OK?

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.100
I'm fine.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.010
Are you hurt?

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.510
Don't worry.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.309
I can handle it.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.780
Save your energy.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.390
If you're willing to

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.010
release the Beasts to fight me,

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.610
I'll be easy on you.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.800
Forget about it!

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.090
I'll ask you one last time.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.280
Release your Beasts!

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:36.800
Honestly,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.920
you aren't my match.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.610
I've wasted too much time on you.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:43.700
So now…

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.600
Are you scared?

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.700
Of course not.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.390
My power is weak.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.410
If I'm as powerful as you,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.110
nothing will scare me.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.330
I can't even make an ice stick.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.600
What's wrong?

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.080
The Mark is buzzing more and more sharply.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.010
Feng Hun,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.070
what's happening to you?

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.450
Give up.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.500
Here it is,

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.810
Feng Hun's secret protector.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.020
Feng Hun,

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.900
are you alright?

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.300
You must hang in there!

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.810
How about we take a rest?

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.300
No need.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.800
Lords and Disciples live and die together.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.610
When Lords are weak,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.090
the Disciples will be weakened, too.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.920
Only by sealing the Mark,

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.720
will our connection be cut off.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.570
Seal the Mark?

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.700
Lords can choose to

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.080
cut off the connection,

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.580
but Disciples can't.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.420
Unless,

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.690
unless they use Dark Magic.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:18.980
Generally speaking,

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.080
Dark Magic

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.700
will hurt Disciples tremendously.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.040
I learnt it behind Feng Hun's back.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.210
I hope I can help him

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.090
whenever he needs me.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.060
Feng Hun.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.720
I'm too weak

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.930
to even make ice spears.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.660
Who attacked me

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:54.730
with that mysterious power?

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.609
You're awake.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:25.619
I'm sorry.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.260
It's all my fault.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.330
No need to apologize.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.210
It's my honor to hold hands

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.330
with such a pretty girl.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.520
We should get out of here.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.010
OK.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.010
You disgusting Beasts!

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.300
Hadn't I been injured,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.580
you wouldn't have gone near me.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.900
Shen Yin,

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.600
show yourself now!

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.490
Who opened this gate?

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.450
Kynil?

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.220
Magnificent!

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.400
Let me collect my Resurgence Chain first,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.400
then I'll find you a powerful Halidom.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.180
On my way here,

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.280
the power of the Beasts has been increasing.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.790
I'm afraid

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.300
I'll soon be

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.710
no match of them.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.330
Specter is here.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.100
Why is his power so weak?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.120
Kill Specter.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.480
This is the best chance.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.810
Specter must die!

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:24.810
Kill him!

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.720
Kill Specter!

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.900
Kill Specter!

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.320
Kill him!

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.080
Kill him!

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.400
Lord VII, Yin Chen?

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.280
And you're…

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.970
Lord V, Feng Hun.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.120
You know me?

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.900
I'm waiting for you.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:21.500
Why?

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.900
You're waiting for your disciple,

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.110
who's in the Mound, right?

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.100
How do you know?

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.620
My disciple Lotus

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.090
is also in the Mound.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.410
She's there to collect her Halidom,

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.060
the Resurgence Chain.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.300
The Resurgence Chain?

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.410
That should belong to Kynil.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:51.710
That's why I'm here.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:53.680
More than one Disciples

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.810
received the same White Order,

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.300
isn't that strange?

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.300
Besides,

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.290
you must've noticed

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.190
I'm severely injured.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:11.100
That's because my disciple and I

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.550
were hunted by Lord of Slaughter.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.040
If he meant to kill you,

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.730
how could you still be alive?

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.980
I'm afraid

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.300
I can't answer you that.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:28.310
But someone else

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.000
in the Abyssal Valley can.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.610
Who?

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.610
Come with me,

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:34.600
and you'll know the answer.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.120
Do you dare?

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.050
Look, is it over there?

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:55.700
That's it.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.870
So this is the Resurgence Chain.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.020
Stay away from me.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.400
I'm going to put it

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:43.200
in my body.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:44.980
During this process,

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.300
do not touch me!

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.600
Stop it!

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:45.320
Rosemary!

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.300
What brings you here?

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.580
Kynil, stop her right now!

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.400
That Chain belongs to me.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.820
It can't be yours.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.130
She was told to come here and collect it.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.480
There must be some mistakes.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.460
The White Order can't be wrong.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.790
You don't believe me?

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.850
I didn't mean that.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.890
Just calm down first.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.900
It's dangerous to interrupt her now.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.190
Feng Hun,

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.010
you tamed the Silver Dragon!

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.100
It's dangerous for you

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.500
to tame it yourself.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:06.880
I…

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:10.580
meant to find the Beast suitable for you.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.100
Thank you, Lotus.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:29.620
Lotus?

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.110
Yeah?

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:31.910
What's wrong?

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:33.630
I made you a talisman.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:34.210
So did I.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.300
I made one for you, too.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.530
This is Dragon's tooth.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.130
Dragons are ferocious,

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:41.720
and their teeth

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.410
are strong and sharp.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.420
Be careful!

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:52.200
Catch me!

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.240
Bring it with you at all times.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.340
I have Dragon's tooth!

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.010
It'll protect you.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.320
I won't lose it.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.900
You're still worried about her?

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.510
You should worry about your lord.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.630
My lord?

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.600
Is he OK?

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:07.540
In order to save you,

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.490
he entered the Mound,

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.280
but got severely injured.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.500
He's at death's door.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.610
Impossible!

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.100
You're lying.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.700
Am I?

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:31.130
From now on,

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.390
I'll be your mentor.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.290
Where did you get it?

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.850
What happened to Yin Chen?

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.410
Now you believe me?

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.190
If you go save him now,

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.310
he may be able to live.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.370
Any more delays,

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.200
it might be too late.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.880
He's so gullible.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.800
What a bonehead!

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.510
Wait…

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.300
Yin Chen's been to the Mound,

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.200
so he wouldn't be able to reenter.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.300
Rosemary lied to me.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:16.800
Oh no,

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.100
Lotus is in danger.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.180
Lotus,

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:45.930
are you OK?

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.220
How did you

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.230
make that big thing covering you?

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:50.400
Looks awesome!

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.130
Can you teach me?

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.320
Did you use Magic?

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.480
If I can do that,

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.800
I won't be bullied again.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.340
That's not Magic.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.360
It's my talisman.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.400
Feng Hun gave it to me

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.450
to protect me in the Mound.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.340
That Chain isn't yours.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:09.450
It should be mine!

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:10.340
Give it back!

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.730
That's ridiculous!

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.380
She's already put it in her body.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.370
How come it's yours?

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:17.820
Can you prove it?

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.480
If I can't have it,

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.690
neither can she!

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.070
Since that Chain is in your body,

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.200
then you must die with it.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.180
Stop, stop.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.550
Fight no more.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.230
What do you say?

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.970
I'll kill you!

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.360
Enough!

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.540
Don't you know

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.850
it's better to make friends

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:03.060
than enemies?

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.080
Who are you to lecture me?

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.920
I don't know

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.910
why you said the Chain was yours,

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.040
but

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.800
it belongs to me now.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.230
All Lords and Disciples

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.930
can only enter the Mound once.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.500
You'd better

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.150
not waste time on things

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:22.210
that don't belong to you.

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:24.560
You can find a better one.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.050
Look around,

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.910
there are plenty of powerful Halidoms.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.940
Let's go find one for you.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:36.660
The clock is ticking.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:38.350
Wait.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:47.180
Rosemary,

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.980
Lotus never lies.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.920
There must be some misunderstandings.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.020
How about we go somewhere with the Golden Fog

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:54.940
to heal your wound first?

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:23.840
Level VI,

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.020
the…

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:26.440
the Immortal Talent.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.290
The Immortal Talent?

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.520
That means…

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:35.210
her wound can be healed instantly?

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.040
Unbelievable!

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:50.050
What about you?

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.889
What's your talent?

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.179
Me?

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:57.139
My talent is…

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:00.130
irresistible charm.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.840
Lotus,

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:08.360
do you know what my talent is?

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.430
Lord VII has always been mysterious.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.560
Nobody knows his talent.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.430
I bet you have no talent at all.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.960
Don't you know I was testing you?

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:25.440
Since neither of you know,

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.120
I'm relieved.

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:27.650
You…

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.210
Don't ask.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.500
I won't tell you, anyway.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:36.010
You'll be intimidated by my talent.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.320
Really?

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.320
Then why did Yin Chen beg for my help?

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:44.700
Besides, he has a message for you.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.850
He begged you?

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.310
What message?

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.200
There are two portals

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.210
in the Mound.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.170
One leads to death,

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.960
and the other

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.320
can take you out of the Mound.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.990
You're lying to me again.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:08.850
I told you out of kindness.

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:10.140
Believe it or not,

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.010
it's up to you.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.990
Well,

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.680
just so you know,

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.830
your lord kneeled in front of me

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.560
in exchange for my help.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:25.460
What did you say?

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.670
He did what?

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.690
You heard me.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:36.300
Why are you so angry?

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.010
He kneeled willingly.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.550
I didn't force him.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:41.680
It's not my fault

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.890
that he's spineless.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:44.100
Shut up!

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:48.780
He did that because of you.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.390
If you hadn't entered the Mound,

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.050
nothing would've happened.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:00.320
I've said enough.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.350
It's your choice

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:02.500
whether to believe me or not.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.450
Yin Chen,

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.640
I'm so sorry.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:18.990
It's all my fault.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.610
I made a mistake.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:21.730
I'm sorry.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.120
Enough of the argument.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:29.970
Go find yourselves Halidoms.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.580
We're running out of time.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.160
Specter, it's me.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.180
Come here.

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:10.400
Your arm…

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:12.680
Listen,

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:14.800
I need your power.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.490
Is that…

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:48.090
Is that your Halidom?

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:48.910
Correct.

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:50.850
That's the Mirror of the Dead.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.940
When battling with your enemies,

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:54.350
they'll only see

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.880
their own reflections in the Mirror.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:58.580
As long as your power is running,

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.940
the Mirror will generate

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.760
countless reflections.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.090
In a word,

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.920
the enemies will be fighting against themselves

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:13.490
till they're exhausted to death.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:14.760
Precisely.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:21.040
You know what was your bracelet made of?

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:28.800
The gems from the Mirror.

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:30.820
That's why we're connected.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:33.120
Right now,

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.200
I can't let you die.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.740
Take me to the Golden Lake.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.660
I have to grow my arm back.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:45.880
You can do whatever you want

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.990
after I arrive there safely.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.290
You're going to the end of the Abyssal Valley?

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.160
Impossible!

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.220
I can't make it.

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.380
I don't have enough Power.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.600
I know that of course.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:05.450
Take the Mirror.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.010
Lead the way.
